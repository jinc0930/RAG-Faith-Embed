All authors contributed equally to this project, we list their contributions below.

Amandeep: I wrote the code for the exploratory data analysis and basic data loading/setting-up when we chose a dataset and wrote section 6.1 about the dataset information. I also wrote the general literature review, and Reagan added additional relevant information about RAG evaluation (specifically faithfulness). When we chose the models, I wrote code for the general RAG pipeline with the baseline embeddings (referred to tutorial/documentation \cite{rag-milvus} and relevant model documentation on HuggingFace) and the RAG pipeline with fine-tuned MedEmbed model; and tested them both with dummy sample data. I then wrote 5.1 Overview of RAG pipeline. As I did not run any of the models completely for the 100 queries subset to get the final faithfulness scores for Table 1, I tried to make up for it by writing the following sections: 1 Abstract, 6.4 Analysis of Results, 6.5 Limitations and Considerations, and 6.6 Conclusion. Our team contributed equally to proofreading efforts. 

Chang: Contributed heavily in coding, especially "Generate Answers" and part of the "Faithfulness" sections. Tested and run embedding with a subset of real data. Contributed to writing, specifically the introduction and part of the problem statement. Contributed to general editing of writing and formatting.

Reagan: Contributed to coding in the evaluation section. Ran eval for all data. Contributed heavily to sections 2(along with Chang),3, 5.2, and 5.3. Responsible for selecting dataset, evaluation model, and identifying MTEB leaderboard for embedding model selection. Responsible for all LaTeX citations, formatting, and style.
