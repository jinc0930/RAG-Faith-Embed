The HP1 family is evolutionarily conserved, with members in \nfungi, plants and animals but not prokaryotes, and there are multiple members \nwithin the same species. The amino-terminal chromodomain binds methylated lysine \n9 of histone H3, causing transcriptional repression. The highly conserved \ncarboxy-terminal chromoshadow domain enables dimerization and also serves as a \ndocking site for proteins involved in a wide variety of nuclear functions, from \ntranscription to nuclear architecture. In addition to heterochromatin packaging, \nit is becoming increasingly clear that HP1 proteins have diverse roles in the \nnucleus, including the regulation of euchromatic genes.

There are seven \nmembers in the human Hes family, Hes1-7, which are expressed in many tissues and \nplay various roles mainly in development. All Hes proteins have three conserved \ndomains: basic HLH (bHLH), Orange, and WRPW domains. The basic region binds to \ntarget DNA sequences, while the HLH region forms homo- and heterodimers with \nother bHLH proteins, the Orange domain is responsible for the selection of \npartners during heterodimer formation, and the WRPW domain recruits \ncorepressors. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of \ncanonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell \ninteraction. Hes factors regulate many events in development by repressing the \nexpression of target genes, many of which encode transcriptional activators that \npromote cell differentiation.

This association was more pronounced for glioblastoma.","retrieval_context":["BACKGROUND: Use of cell phones has increased dramatically since 1992 when they \nwere first introduced in France. Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely \nlow frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency \ntechnology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has \ngenerated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate \nthe relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of \nthe head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. \nThis publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study.\nMETHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and \ncentral nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. \nEligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly \ndiagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The \ndiagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal \nradiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+\/-5 years) and \nplace of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed \ninformation was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted \nface-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the \nodds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of \neach type of cancer.\nRESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of \nneuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95% \nconfidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence \ninterval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant, \na general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the \nheaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of \ntelephones.\nCONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was \nobserved among cell phone users participating in Interphone.

This test \nassigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a \nbody-mass index of 25kg\/m2 to less than 30kg\/m2 or 5 points for having a \nbody-mass index of 30kg\/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being \nolder than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.\nRESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5\u00b112.1 years, with a neck \ncircumference of 41.0\u00b13.6cm and a BMI of 30.8\u00b15.1kg\/m2. OSA was present in 84.0% \nof the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA.

If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the \nbeneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that \nh=1\/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory \nfor selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that \ngenetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance \n0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs. \nMoreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele. \nWe find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until \nfixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of \u221a(N\/s) generations, if N \nis the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic \ndiversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other \ncases.","Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic \ndiversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly \ncarry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early \nin a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay \nbetween mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a \ncharacteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation \nthat depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection \ncoefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator \nfor the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the \nnovel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on \npreexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination. \nCompared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the \nsize of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator \nrequires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture \nlow-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard \napproaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our \nestimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a \nconsequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of \nrecombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply \nour estimator to deep sequencing data from human immunodeficiency virus \npopulations.","Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such \nas the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply \nof adaptive genetic variation.

These results suggest that transcriptional \nactivation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated \nexpression.","In earlier work, we demonstrated that 5'-CG-3' methylation inhibits the \ntranscriptional activity of human Alu elements associated with the alpha \n1-globin and the angiogenin genes in a cell-free transcription system from HeLa \nnuclear extracts. These studies have been extended to different Alu sequences \nand to investigations on the mechanism involved in transcriptional silencing by \nmethylation. By comparing the results of DNase I and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in \nvitro footprinting on a consensus sequence in the RNA polymerase III promoter \ncontrol B region between the unmethylated and the 5'-CG-3' methylated B box, \nevidence has been adduced for effects of 5'-CG-3' methylation on the interaction \nof specific nuclear proteins with DNA sequences in the B control region of the \nAlu elements. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the \n5'-CG-3' methylation interferes with the binding of proteins that are essential \nfor the function of the B control region in these RNA polymerase III-transcribed \nelements, and that promoter methylation thus inhibits transcription.","Intronless genes (IGs) constitute approximately 3% of the human genome.

IGs also often display tissue-specific \nexpression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics \ntranslate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental \ndisorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created \nmostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality. \nProcessing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered \ndramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature \ntranscripts and govern their fate.

They have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological pathways, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and are emerging as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets, particularly in cancer.","retrieval_context":["Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are currently classed as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that, \nunlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and act as gene \nregulators in mammals. They were originally thought to represent errors in \nsplicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an \nincreased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs \nare differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. \nUnlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have \nbeen joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization. \nInterestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and \nrelatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential \nfunctions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to \nRNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene \ntranscription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the \ntranscriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and \nthat circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation \nand progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue \ncompared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice \nmachinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated \nmiRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a \nreduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more \nrecently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate \naberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments.

Although much remains to be elucidated about circRNA biology and \nmechanisms of gene regulation, these ncRNAs are quickly emerging as potential \ndisease biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that \nhave recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to \nsuppress microRNAs, thereby increasing the translation and stability of the \ntargets of such microRNAs. In this review, we discuss the emerging functions of \ncircRNAs, including RNA transcription, splicing, turnover, and translation. We \nalso discuss other possible facets of circRNAs that can influence their function \ndepending on the cell context, such as circRNA abundance, subcellular \nlocalization, interacting partners (RNA, DNA, and proteins), dynamic changes in \ninteractions following stimulation, and potential circRNA translation. The \nensuing changes in gene expression patterns elicited by circRNAs are proposed to \ndrive key cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and \nsurvival, that govern health and disease.

Deletion analysis showed that a 41-bp fragment (-249 to -209 bp) \ncontaining the MEF-2-like motif is an essential element for minimal \ncardiac-specific expression of the rat cTnT gene. The proximal promoter (-208 to \n-1 bp) contains two consensus CArG boxes, one M-CAT motif, one AP2 site, and one \nTATA box. The construct (cTNT-208) composed of the CAT reporter gene driven by \nthis proximal promoter did not show cardiac muscle-specific expression. Ligation \nof consensus MEF-2-like sequence into the upstream of this chimera only \npartially increased its ability to express in cardiomyocytes. These results \nsuggest that the spacing among MEF-2-like motif and proximal promoter and\/or the \nflanking sequences of the MEF-2-like motif are important in determining cardiac \nmuscle-specific expression. By footprint analysis with a DNA fragment (-303 to \n+6 bp), we identified three novel regions (called A, B, and C) protected by \nprotein extract from rat hearts, in addition to the known motifs such as MEF-2, \nM-CAT, and CArG.

Our data \ndemonstrate a reciprocal relationship between Hmgb2 and Ctcf in controlling \naspects of chromatin structure and gene expression. Both proteins regulate each \nothers' expression as well as transcription in cardiac myocytes; however, only \nHmgb2 does so in a manner that involves global reprogramming of chromatin \naccessibility. We demonstrate that the actions of Hmgb2 on local chromatin \naccessibility are conserved across genomic loci, whereas the effects on \ntranscription are loci-dependent and emerge in concert with histone modification \nand other chromatin features. Finally, although both proteins share gene \ntargets, Hmgb2 and Ctcf, neither binds these genes simultaneously nor do they \nphysically colocalize in myocyte nuclei. Our study uncovers a previously unknown \nrelationship between these two ubiquitous chromatin proteins and provides a \nmechanistic explanation for how Hmgb2 regulates gene expression and cellular \nphenotype. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence for structural remodeling of \nchromatin on a genome-wide scale in the setting of cardiac disease.","MCAT elements are essential for cardiac gene expression during development. \nAvian transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) proteins are muscle-enriched and \ncontribute to MCAT binding activities.

Divergent \nTEF (DTEF)-1 is a unique member of the TEF-1 multigene family with abundant \ntranscripts in the heart but not in skeletal muscle. Herein we show that DTEF-1 \nproteins are highly expressed in the heart. Protein expression is activated at \nvery early stages of chick embryogenesis (Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4, 16-18 h), \nafter which DTEF-1 becomes abundant in the sinus venosus and is expressed in the \ntrabeculated ventricular myocardium and ventricular outflow tracts. By chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation, DTEF-1 interacts with the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) \npromoter in vivo. DTEF-1 also interacts with MEF- 2 by coimmunoprecipitation and \nindependently or cooperatively (with MEF-2) trans-activates the cTnT promoter. \nDTEF-1 isoforms do not activate the cTnT promoter in fibroblasts or skeletal \nmuscle. DTEF-1 expression occurs very early in chick embryogenesis (16-18 h), \npreceding sarcomeric protein expression, and it activates cardiac promoters. As \nsuch, DTEF-1 may be an early marker of the myocardial phenotype. DTEF-1 \ntrans-activates the cTnT promoter in a tissue-specific fashion independent of \nAT-rich, MEF-2, or GATA sites. The observed spatial pattern suggests decreasing \nlevels of expression from the cardiac inlet to the ventricular outflow tracts, \nwhich may mark a cardiogenic or differentiation pathway that parallels the \ndirection of flow through the developing chick heart."]}

At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial \nfor various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity, \nlearning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent \nmodifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated \nwith stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past \nthree decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In \nmammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of \u03b1-tubulin \nacetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies \nof the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of \ntubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to \nneurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological \nconditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review \nsummarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important \nfor regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity. \nTogether with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin \nacetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and \nfunction.","Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating \nmicrotubule stability and function.

Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant \nin stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as \nneuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes \nresponsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. \nHere we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions \nas a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where \nit associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex \ncontaining p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a \nglobal deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases \nalpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates \nalpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 \npromotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated \ndeacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Our results show \nthat HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provide evidence that reversible \nacetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism \nand gene transcription.","Enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family posttranslationally \nmodify and thereby mark microtubules by glutamylation, generating specific \nrecognition sites for microtubule-interacting proteins.

{"input":"Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?","actual_output":"Yes, Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are considered good anticancer therapeutic targets. During the initial stages of tumor development, TAMs can exhibit antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or recruiting and activating other immune cells. However, as genetic changes occur within the tumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to exhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This shift towards an immunosuppressive phenotype is crucial to the tumor's ability to evade the immune system and proliferate. Therefore, strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to support an antitumor immune response, or depleting them from the TME, have emerged as potential strategies for cancer therapy.","retrieval_context":["Tumorigenesis is not only determined by the intrinsic properties of cancer cells \nbut also by their interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment \n(TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune \ncells in the TME. During initial stages of tumor development, macrophages can \neither directly promote antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or indirectly \nrecruit and activate other immune cells. As genetic changes occur within the \ntumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to \nexhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression, \nmetastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting TAMs has emerged as a \nstrategy for cancer therapy. To date, TAM targeting strategies have focused on \nmacrophage depletion and inhibition of their recruitment into the TME. However, \nthese strategies have shown limited therapeutic efficacy, although trials are \nstill underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the \npotential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the \ndevelopment of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune \nresponse. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their \nimmunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint \ninhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting \nstrategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial \nstages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.","In the last decade, it has been well-established that tumor-infiltrating myeloid \ncells fuel not only the process of carcinogenesis through cancer-related \ninflammation mechanisms, but also tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. \nIn particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant \nleucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a \nprotective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an \nimmune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to \nallow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional \ntherapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit \ncancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also \nresponsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint \ninhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to \ndeplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as \nweapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the \nreprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral \nmacrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells. This \nshift eventually leads to the reconstitution of a reactive immune landscape able \nto destroy the tumor. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on \nstrategies able to reprogram TAMs with single as well as combination therapies.","Cancer therapy has developed around the concept of killing, or stopping the \ngrowth of, the cancer cells.

In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated \nmacrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to \ncancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the \nmajor phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer \ntreatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor \nangiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many \npreclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation \nand anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs \nfrom tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype. \nThe data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting \nTAMs with conventional therapy.

In humans, the absence of GFI1B leads to embryonic lethality due to failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of its function in adult hematopoiesis. In addition, GFI1B has been shown to regulate the expression of the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, which is a direct target of GFI-1B. Alterations in TGF-beta signaling due to GFI1B knockdown can affect erythroid differentiation.","retrieval_context":["Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in \nhematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs \nrequired for hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage \nspecification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), \nmyeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC, \nmegakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for \nprimitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in \ndefinitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we \nreport the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi \nfactor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and \ndefinitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses \ndemonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive \nand definitive hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. Loss of gfi1aa silences \nmarkers of early primitive progenitors, scl and gata1. Conversely, loss of gfi1b \nsilences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for \ndefinitive hematopoiesis. We determine the epistatic relationships between the \ngfi factors and key hematopoietic transcription factors, demonstrating that \ngfi1aa and gfi1b join lmo2, scl, runx-1 and c-myb as critical regulators of \nteleost HSPC. Our studies establish a comparative paradigm for the regulation of \nhematopoietic lineages by gfi transcription factors.","In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified \nthat the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly \nrestricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 \nand Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc \nfinger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid \nmalignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been \nwell characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human \nhematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic \nprogenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an \nerythropoietin-independent manner. Expression of Gfi-1B did not promote \nerythroid commitment, but enhanced proliferation of immature erythroblasts. \nErythroblasts expanded by exogenous Gfi-1B, however, failed to differentiate \nbeyond proerythroblast stage and showed massive apoptosis. These biologic \neffects of Gfi-1B were mediated through its zinc finger domain, but not by the \nSNAG or non-zinc finger domain. Proliferation of erythroblasts was associated \nwith sustained expression of GATA-2 but not of GATA-1, indicating a potential \nlink between Gfi-1B and GATA family regulators. Importantly, the function of \nGfi-1B to modulate transcription was dependent on promoter context. In addition, \nactivation of transcription of an artificial promoter was mediated through its \nzinc finger domain. These findings establish Gfi-1B as a novel erythroid \nregulator and reveal its specific involvement in the regulation of erythroid \ncell growth through modulating erythroid-specific gene expression.","Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential \nfor erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.

Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth \nfactor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2 \nphosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary \nfactor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2\/TIF1-gamma complex is known to \nspecifically regulate erythroid differentiation, we propose that, by repressing \nTGF-beta type III receptor (TbetaRIotaII) expression, Gfi-1B favors the \nSmad2\/TIF1-gamma interaction downstream of TGF-beta signaling, allowing immature \nprogenitors to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage."]}

This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many \neukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral \nprotein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing \n(adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear \nto be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis \nof cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by \nanciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some \nadaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an \nindependently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding \nof their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine \nwhether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates \nderived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and \nfungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in \ninferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by \ndeeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is \nan increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence.

The prevalent linkages of editing in these two \nclades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be \nassociated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural \nselection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we \nonly detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which \nwere not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of \nworms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA \nsites to escape promiscuous editing.

In pulmonary \ncarcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP \nlevels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor \nligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from \nthe carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction \nmarker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different \nreceptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n(RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 \nof the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in \nthe majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE \ngradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions \nof culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of \nseven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were \nproduced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were \nproduced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times \nthat of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were \nequivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR \nand NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was \nadapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed \nA549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. \nUsing either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and \nGRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for \nBLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and\/or receptor \nsubtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially \nrecognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in \nthe BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The \n2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that \nshowed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against \nthe 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), \ncompared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and \nNMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and \nGRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and \nexpression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and \nexpression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be \ntargeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and \nGRP."]}

Iodine tablets \nshould be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in \nsituations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be \nunderlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; \nother measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures \nwill protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other \nradionuclides that may be released.

In this \nstudy, we have identified the mutations in two pccB, one pccC, and two pccBC \ncell lines and have deduced those alleles participating in interallelic \ncomplementation. One pccB line was a compound heterozygote of Pro228Leu and \nAsn536Asp. The latter mutation was also detected in a noncomplementing pccBC \nline. This leaves Pro228Leu responsible for complementation in the pccB cells. \nThe second pccB line contained an insertional duplication, dupKICK140-143, and a \nsplice mutation IVS + 1 G-->T, located after Lys466.

A greater heterogeneity is observed in the \nPCCA gene, specially in Caucasians, with no prevalent mutations, while in the \nJapanese population three mutations account for more than half of the alleles \nstudied.

Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links \nbetween AMPK-\u03b1 isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG \nassociation of AMPK-\u03b12, but not AMPK-\u03b11. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK \nactivity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered \nwith SG formation. Second, AMPK-\u03b1 knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative \nSG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, \noverexpression of mutant \u03b1-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG \nparameters.

The Scribble complex is one of at least three interacting protein \ncomplexes that have a critical role in establishing and maintaining epithelial \npolarity. In human colorectal, breast, and endometrial cancers, expression of \nthe Scribble complex member SCRIB is often mislocalized and deregulated. Here, \nwe report that Scrib is indispensable for prostate homeostasis in mice. Scrib \nheterozygosity initiated prostate hyperplasia, while targeted biallelic Scrib \nloss predisposed mice to prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Mechanistically, \nScrib was shown to negatively regulate the MAPK cascade to suppress \ntumorigenesis. Further analysis revealed that prostate-specific loss of Scrib in \nmice combined with expression of an oncogenic Kras mutation promoted the \nprogression of prostate cancer that recapitulated the human disease. The \nclinical significance of the work in mice was highlighted by our observation \nthat SCRIB deregulation strongly correlated with poor survival in human prostate \ncancer. These data suggest that the polarity network could provide a new avenue \nfor therapeutic intervention.","The activity of cullin-RING type ubiquitination E3 ligases is regulated by \nneddylation, a process analogous to ubiquitination that culminates in covalent \nattachment of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to cullins. As a component of the \nE3 for neddylation, SCCRO\/DCUN1D1 plays a key regulatory role in neddylation \nand, consequently, cullin-RING ligase activity. The essential contribution of \nSCCRO to neddylation is to promote nuclear translocation of the cullin-ROC1 \ncomplex. The presence of a myristoyl sequence in SCCRO3, one of four SCCRO \nparalogues present in humans that localizes to the membrane, raises questions \nabout its function in neddylation. We found that although SCCRO3 binds to CAND1, \ncullins, and ROC1, it does not efficiently bind to Ubc12, promote cullin \nneddylation, or conform to the reaction processivity paradigms, suggesting that \nSCCRO3 does not have E3 activity. Expression of SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO-promoted \nneddylation by sequestering cullins to the membrane, thereby blocking its \nnuclear translocation. Moreover, SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO transforming activity. \nThe inhibitory effects of SCCRO3 on SCCRO-promoted neddylation and \ntransformation require both an intact myristoyl sequence and PONY domain, \nconfirming that membrane localization and binding to cullins are required for in \nvivo functions. Taken together, our findings suggest that SCCRO3 functions as a \ntumor suppressor by antagonizing the neddylation activity of SCCRO."]}

Among these, CYP2D6 is often considered one of the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans, but it is not the second most frequently implicated enzyme across all drugs. The second most frequently implicated enzyme may vary depending on the specific class of drugs under consideration.","retrieval_context":["Cytochrome P450 (P450) 17A enzymes play a critical role in the oxidation of the \nsteroids progesterone (Prog) and pregnenolone (Preg) to glucocorticoids and \nandrogens.

The models reported by \nvarious scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to \nvisually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by \ndifferent researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different \nsets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a \nsingle model with good predictive values. One of the main reasons for this \nchallenge is related to relatively large size of the active sites and \nflexibility of the CYP isoenzymes, which results in multiple binding sites. We \npropose development of multiple- diverse pharmacophore models for each binding \nmode (as opposed to a single predictive model for each CYP isoenzyme). After \nscoring and prioritization of the models, we propose the use of a battery of \npharmacophore models for each CYP isoenzyme binding mode to computationally \nobtain a P450 interaction profile for drug candidates early in the drug \ndevelopment cycle, when decisions on their fate can be made before incurring the \ncosts of synthesis and testing.","The aims of the present study were to determine cytochrome P450 enzyme activity \nin six strains of experimental rodents (n = 5\/sex\/species): ICR, C57BL\/6 and \nDBA\/2 mice; Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats; and Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs. \nAfter animals were treated with the typical inducers \u03b2-naphthoflavone (BNF), \ndexamethasone (DEX) and phenobarbital (PB), the levels of O-dealkylation of \nethoxyresorufin (EROD), methoxyresorufin (MROD), pentoxyresorufin (PROD) and \nbenzyloxyresorufin (BROD) activity were determined using responsive catalytic \nreactions to study CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2B, respectively.

Inhibition of CRM1 \nfunction by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the \ncytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of \nendogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with \nthe 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased \nthe cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript, \nas well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both \nparameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was \naccompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic \nLuc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was \nobserved in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback \nmechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the \nregulation of HuR during replicative senescence.","HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic \ndevelopment, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of \nHuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse \nmodel (Elavl1M\u00f8 KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived \nmacrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in \nAU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from \nElavl1M\u00f8 KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs. \nInterestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is \nup-regulated in Elavl1M\u00f8 KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to \nthe HuR binding sites, suggesting competitive regulation of gene expression. One \nsuch mRNA encodes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a major regulator \nof angiogenesis. Immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes and luciferase \nreporter assays indicate that HuR antagonizes the suppressive activity of \nmiR-200b, down-regulates miR-200b expression, and promotes VEGF-A expression. \nIndeed, Vegf-a and other angiogenic regulatory transcripts were down-regulated \nin Elavl1M\u00f8 KO BMDMs. Interestingly, tumor growth, angiogenesis, vascular \nsprouting, branching, and permeability were significantly attenuated in Elavl1M\u00f8 \nKO mice, suggesting that HuR-regulated myeloid-derived factors modulate tumor \nangiogenesis in trans. Zebrafish embryos injected with an elavl1 morpholino \noligomer or miR-200b mimic showed angiogenesis defects in the subintestinal vein \nplexus, and elavl1 mRNA rescued the repressive effect of miR-200b. In addition, \nmiR-200b and HuR morpholino oligomer suppressed the activity of a zVEGF 3'-UTR \nluciferase reporter construct. Together, these studies reveal an evolutionarily \nconserved post-transcriptional mechanism involving competitive interactions \nbetween HuR and miR-200b that controls angiogenesis.","The RNA-binding protein HuR, while known to stabilize cytoplasmic mRNAs, is \nlargely nuclear.

This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and \nespecially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a \nconsequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major \ndeterminant of nucleosome positioning in vivo.

In particular, \nthe precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been \ncontroversial. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of \nhitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5\u2009bp periodicity, \nand poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome \nlandscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our \ncomputational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and \nnucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to \nother previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo \nnucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content \nis the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase \ndigestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, \npoly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the \nexperimental method used. We further show that the 10.5\u2009bp nucleotide \nperiodicity facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying \nour method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, \nthe regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites \ncan be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone. Finally, in vivo \nnucleosome occupancy derived from MNase-seq experiments around transcription \ntermination sites can be mostly explained by the genomic sequence.

The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time.

{"input":"Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?","actual_output":"The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.","retrieval_context":["Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the \nresistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the \nsusceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). \nIn SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. \nMurine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous \nlupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes \nSLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted \nTLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic \ncells (pDC), monocytes\/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes \nsingle-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the \nproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each \ncell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage \nwith XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome \ninactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been \nhypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female \nimmune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. \nWe review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent \nevidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, \nmonocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B \ncells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven \nfunctional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the \nenhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent \nautoimmune syndromes.","Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity, \nbut TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also \nelevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more \nsupernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement \ncontributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and \nwe examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome \ninactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. \nSingle-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial \nfractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells \nnot only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X \nchromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 \ntranscriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher \nTLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic \nB cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of \nCD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold \nincrease over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class \nswitch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B \nlymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation \nendows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This \nfinding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to \nbiallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune \ndisorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.","INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome \nXp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production.

Conditional logistic regression \nanalysis revealed that the association of the intronic SNPs and the 3' UTR SNP \nremained significant after we adjusted them for each other. When only the \npatients and controls carrying the risk genotypes at the 3' UTR SNP position \nwere analyzed, the risk of SLE was significantly increased when the individuals \nalso carried the risk genotypes at both of the intronic SNPs (P = 0.0043, OR \n2.45, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.60).

Saracatinib blocked the Src\/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic \nsignaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and \nNCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family \nmember Bim.

Additionally, T2 increased the muscle contents of fast\/glycolytic fibers and sarcolemmal glucose transporter 4, which are associated with fat metabolism. Furthermore, it is suggested that thyronamines may be a potentially treatment for obesity and reduction of cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a). However, it is important to note that the specific effects of different thyronamines on fat tissue may vary, and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved.","retrieval_context":["Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone. \nSystemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a \nlesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia, \ndecreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize \nthat the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines. \nWe investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines \nrecapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p. \nthyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and \nendogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored \nin rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg\/kg) or i.c.v.

Intervention group \nparticipants were also eligible for the ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and \nTreatment) RCT evaluating active monitoring, radiotherapy and radical \nprostatectomy treatments for localised prostate cancer. In ProtecT, over 1500 of \naround 3000 men with prostate cancer were randomised from over 10,000 with an \nelevated PSA in around 111,000 attendees at clinics. Investigation of the \npsychological impact of screening in a sub-sample showed that 10% of men still \nexperienced high distress up to 3 months following prostate biopsies (22\/227), \nalthough most were relatively unaffected. The risk of prostate cancer with a \nraised PSA was lower if urinary symptoms were present (frequent nocturia odds \nratio (OR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.83) or if a repeat PSA \ndecreased by > or = 20% prior to biopsy (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.52). Men aged \n45-49 years attended PSA clinics less frequently (442\/1299, 34%) in a nested \ncohort with a cancer detection rate of 2.3% (10\/442). The CAP and ProtecT trials \n(ISRCTN92187251 and ISRCTN20141217) will help resolve the prostate cancer \nscreening debate, define the optimum treatment for localised disease and \ngenerate evidence to improve men's health."]}

In addition to a \nfundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be \ntransmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations \n(epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations \nand be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. \nHowever, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are \nunknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary \nadaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan \norganism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and \nstability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode \nCaenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate \napproximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have \nshort half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations \nlast at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus \ncontribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to \nbring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.","Only a minority of the genes, identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome \nsequence data by computer analysis, have been characterized experimentally.

Further support for this surprisingly high figure \nwas sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans \ngenes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having \nbeen recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the \nrecently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can \nbe recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. \nLessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in \nthe annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be \nfewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.","BACKGROUND: While the C. elegans genome is extensively annotated, relatively \nlittle information is available for other Caenorhabditis species.

Seventeen groups worldwide \nparticipated in nGASP, and submitted 47 prediction sets across 10 Mb of the C. \nelegans genome.

Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction \nrather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is \nrequired for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless \ninteracts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential \nfunction of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while \nTail and CKM play regulatory roles.","Mediator is a multi-unit molecular complex that plays a key role in transferring \nsignals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. We \nhave combined biochemical purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator \nfrom chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator \noccupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically \nwith Mediator on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in \nimmunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between \nMediator and the RSC, Arp2\/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin. \nThese factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly, \nmRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been \nshown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we \nhave found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies \nchromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin \nassociates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries, \nsuch as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4. This suggests that Mediator plays a \nsignificant role in higher-order genome organization."]}
{"input":"Is colistin an antibiotic?","actual_output":"Yes, colistin is an antibiotic. In the provided context, it is mentioned that polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) exhibited synergistic activity with lacticin 3147. Colistin is a member of the polymyxin family of antibiotics.","retrieval_context":["BACKGROUND: The emergence of bacterial drug resistance encourages the \nre-evaluation of the potential of existing antimicrobials. Lantibiotics are \npost-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides \nwith a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Here, we focussed on expanding the \npotential of lacticin 3147, one of the most studied lantibiotics and one which \npossesses potent activity against a wide range of Gram positive species \nincluding many nosocomial pathogens. More specifically, our aim was to \ninvestigate if lacticin 3147 activity could be enhanced when combined with a \nrange of different clinical antibiotics.\nRESULTS: Initial screening revealed that polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) \nexhibited synergistic activity with lacticin 3147. Checkerboard assays were \nperformed against a number of strains, including both Gram positive and Gram \nnegative species. The resultant fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index \nvalues established that, while partial synergy was detected against Gram \npositive targets, synergy was obvious against Gram negative species, including \nCronobacter and E. coli.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combining lacticin 3147 with low levels of a polymyxin could \nprovide a means of broadening target specificity of the lantibiotic, while also \nreducing polymyxin use due to the lower concentrations required as a result of \nsynergy.","Acute gastroenteritis is a common cause of emergency and office visits. This \narticle reviews causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The \nincidence of antibiotic-associated colitis is increasing worldwide as a \nconsequence of widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for various \nillnesses. The pathogenic organism, Clostridium difficile, produces two \nenterotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that cause colonic mucosal inflammation. C. \ndifficile infection presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from \nasymptomatic carriers to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis.","Gastrointestinal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide \neach year. Treatment of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions such as \nulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is difficult due to the ambiguity \nsurrounding their precise aetiology. Infectious gastrointestinal diseases, such \nas various types of diarrheal disease are also becoming increasingly difficult \nto treat due to the increasing dissemination of antibiotic resistance among \nmicroorganisms and the emergence of the so-called 'superbugs'. Taking into \nconsideration these problems, the need for novel therapeutics is essential. \nAlthough described for over a century probiotics have only been extensively \nresearched in recent years. Their use in the treatment and prevention of \ndisease, particularly gastrointestinal disease, has yielded many successful \nresults, some of which we outline in this review. Although promising, many \nprobiotics are hindered by inherent physiological and technological weaknesses \nand often the most clinically promising strains are unusable. Consequently we \ndiscuss various strategies whereby probiotics may be engineered to create \ndesigner probiotics. Such innovative approaches include; a receptor mimicry \nstrategy to create probiotics that target specific pathogens and toxins, a \npatho-biotechnology approach using pathogen-derived genes to create more robust \nprobiotic stains with increased host and processing-associated stress tolerance \nprofiles and meta-biotechnology, whereby, functional metagenomics may be used to \nidentify novel genes from diverse and vastly unexplored environments, such as \nthe human gut, for use in biotechnology and medicine."]}
