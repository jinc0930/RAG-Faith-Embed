Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and \nhomozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal \ngenetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that \nof histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone \nproteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in \ndetermination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. \nConsistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling \nH3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. \nCopy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, \nremoving and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at \nH3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the \npathogenesis of medulloblastoma.","Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain \ntumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To \nassess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify \ncritical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status \nof 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), \nCASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma \ncell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG \nmethylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the \ncerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in \nmedulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41\/44 primary tumours versus \n0\/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a \nsubset of primary tumours (17\/44 and 14\/39) occurred against a consistent \nbackground of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore \nindicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are \ntumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes \nin medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic \ntranscriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following \ntreatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The \nremaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF), \np16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3, \nTP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum \n(EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in \nmedulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation \naffects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a \nconcordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic \nTSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify \nRASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. \nFurthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the \nrequirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the \ntumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.","Recent sequencing efforts have described the mutational landscape of the \npediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Although MLL2 is among the most frequent \nsomatic single nucleotide variants (SNV), the clinical and biological \nsignificance of these mutations remains uncharacterized. Through targeted \nre-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14\/175) of MBs, the \nmajority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations \naffecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7\/175) of tumors. While MLL2 \nmutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or \nmolecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 \nMBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical \nstaining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A \nactivity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % \n(53\/220) of MBs across all subgroups.

Therefore, the exact role of STAG1\/STAG2 proteins in differentiation cannot be definitively answered based on the provided information.","retrieval_context":["Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis \nand mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene \nexpression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function \nalterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led \nto increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy. \nHere we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and \nan emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer \ncells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode \nmutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. \nWe inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes \nhave variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that \nthe simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell \nproliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing \na vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1\/STAG2 double gene knockout. We \nprovide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers \nwith inactivating alterations of STAG2.","STAG\/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister \nchromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1\/SA1 \nand STAG2\/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are \nfound in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the \ncohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are \nRad21\/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member, \nSTAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin \ncomplex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be \nresponsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement \nof the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell \nmaturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in \nseveral meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin \ncomplex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to \nmaintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.","Two variant cohesin complexes containing SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and either SA1 (also \nknown as STAG1) or SA2 (also known as STAG2) are present in all cell types. We \nreport here their genomic distribution and specific contributions to genome \norganization in human cells. Although both variants are found at CCCTC-binding \nfactor (CTCF) sites, a distinct population of the SA2-containing cohesin \ncomplexes (hereafter referred to as cohesin-SA2) localize to enhancers lacking \nCTCF, are linked to tissue-specific transcription and cannot be replaced by the \nSA1-containing cohesin complex (cohesin-SA1) when SA2 is absent, a condition \nthat has been observed in several tumors. Downregulation of each of these \nvariants has different consequences for gene expression and genome architecture. \nOur results suggest that cohesin-SA1 preferentially contributes to the \nstabilization of topologically associating domain boundaries together with CTCF, \nwhereas cohesin-SA2 promotes cell-type-specific contacts between enhancers and \npromoters independently of CTCF.

This suggests a potential link between long-term use of wireless phones and the development of glioblastoma. However, it's important to note that this is an observational study, and causation cannot be definitively established.","retrieval_context":["BACKGROUND: Use of cell phones has increased dramatically since 1992 when they \nwere first introduced in France. Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely \nlow frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency \ntechnology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has \ngenerated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate \nthe relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of \nthe head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. \nThis publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study.\nMETHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and \ncentral nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. \nEligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly \ndiagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The \ndiagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal \nradiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+\/-5 years) and \nplace of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed \ninformation was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted \nface-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the \nodds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of \neach type of cancer.\nRESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of \nneuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95% \nconfidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence \ninterval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant, \na general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the \nheaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of \ntelephones.\nCONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was \nobserved among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical \npower of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility \nof an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in \nthe international INTERPHONE analyses.","BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in \nrelation to the use of wireless phones.\nMETHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour \n(n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date \nof diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012.\nRESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones) \ngave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with > \n10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02).

The aim of this study \nwas to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years) \nuse of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We \nconducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged \n18-75 years and diagnosed during 2007-2009. One population-based control matched \non gender and age (within 5 years) was used to each case. Here, we report on \nmalignant cases including all available controls.

The results for cordless phone use were \nOR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.9, and, for latency of 15-20 years, the OR=2.1, 95% \nCI=1.2-3.8. Few participants had used a cordless phone for >20-25 years. Digital \ntype of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave \nincreased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following \nlatency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral \nuse resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use. \nHigher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes. \nUsing the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat \nhigher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall \nor observational bias.

The clinical syndrome associates dementia, \nparkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is \ncortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or \ndelusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse \nLewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains \nunclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.","Lewy bodies, the characteristic pathological lesion of substantia nigra neurons \nin Parkinson's disease (PD), are frequently observed to accompany the amyloid \nplaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However \nthe typical anatomic distribution of Lewy bodies in AD is distinct from PD. The \nmost common site of occurrence is the amygdala, where Lewy bodies are observed \nin approximately 60% of both sporadic and familial AD. Other common sites of \noccurrence include the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortex, while neocortical \nand brainstem areas develop Lewy bodies in a lower percentage of cases. In \ncontrast, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), defined by widespread neocortical and \nbrainstem Lewy bodies but frequently accompanied by variable levels of AD-type \npathology, represents the other end of a spectrum of pathology associated with \ndementia. The observation of Lewy bodies in familial AD cases suggests that like \nneurofibrillary tangles, the formation of Lewy bodies can be induced by the \npathological state caused by Abeta-amyloid overproduction. The role of Lewy body \nformation in the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons remains unclear. The \nprotein alpha-synuclein appears to be an important structural component of Lewy \nbodies, an observation spurred by the discovery of point mutations in the \nalpha-synuclein gene linked to rare cases of autosomal dominant PD. Further \ninvestigation of alpha-synuclein and its relationship to pathological conditions \npromoting Lewy body formation in AD, PD, and DLB may yield further insight into \npathogenesis of these diseases.","Synucleinopathies comprise a diverse group of neurodegenerative proteinopathies \nthat share common pathological lesions composed of aggregates of conformational \nand posttranslational modifications of alpha-synuclein in selected populations \nof neurons and glia.

The aim of this study was to assess the \neffectiveness of the NoSAS score in predicting the presence of OSAS among \nparticipants with current MDE and to compare it with the performance of existing \nscreening tools.\nMETHODS: A random sample of the population-based cohort CoLaus (Lausanne, \nSwitzerland) underwent a psychiatric evaluation (PsyCoLaus) and a complete \npolysomnography at home (HypnoLaus). The effectiveness of the NoSAS score in \ndetecting the risk of significant OSAS among current MDE participants was \nassessed and compared with STOP-BANG and Berlin scores.\nRESULTS: Among the 1761 subjects (58,75 \u00b1 11y.o.; 47,8%men) who underwent \npolysomnography, significant OSAS was present in 24.0% with and 26.1% without \ncurrent MDE. Using a threshold of \u2265 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in \nMDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative \npredictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area \nunder the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the \nBerlin score (NS).\nLIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The \nstudied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening \ntools for OSAS in MDE.

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive \nvalue, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating \ncharacteristic curve (AUC) of both screening tools were calculated at different \nAHI cutoffs to compare the performance of SDB screening.\nRESULTS: Of the 596 eligible patients (397 males and 199 female), 514 were \ndiagnosed with SDB. When predicting overall (AHI\u2009\u2265\u20095), moderate-to-severe \n(AHI\u2009\u2265\u200915), and severe (AHI\u2009\u2265\u200930) SDB, the sensitivity and specificity of the \nNoSAS score were 71.2, 80.4, and 83.1% and 62.4, 49.3, and 40.7%, respectively. \nAt all AHI cutoffs, the AUC ranged from 0.688 to 0.715 for the NoSAS score and \nfrom 0.663 to 0.693 for the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score had the \nlargest AUC (0.715, 95% CI: 0.655-0.775) of diagnosing SDB at AHI cutoff of \u22655 \nevents\/h. NoSAS performed better in discriminating moderate-to-severe SDB than \nSTOP-Bang with a marginally significantly higher AUC (0.697 vs. 0.663, P=0.046).\nCONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had good performance on the discrimination of SDB \npatients in sleep clinic and can be utilized as an effective screening tool in \nclinical practice."]}

{"input":"Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?","actual_output":"No, a selective sweep typically reduces genetic variation. It occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection, and the frequency of the favored allele increases in the population. Due to genetic hitchhiking, the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating regions of reduced variation. This is the opposite of an increase in genetic variation.","retrieval_context":["Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic \ndiversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly \ncarry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early \nin a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay \nbetween mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a \ncharacteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation \nthat depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection \ncoefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator \nfor the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the \nnovel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on \npreexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination. \nCompared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the \nsize of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator \nrequires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture \nlow-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard \napproaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our \nestimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a \nconsequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of \nrecombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply \nour estimator to deep sequencing data from human immunodeficiency virus \npopulations.","A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to \nstrong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the \nbeneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that \nh=1\/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory \nfor selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that \ngenetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance \n0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs. \nMoreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele. \nWe find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until \nfixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of \u221a(N\/s) generations, if N \nis the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic \ndiversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other \ncases.","Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The \nfrequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic \nhitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called \nselective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved \nby searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of \nreduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and \nparticular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used \nfor detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary \nstatistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use \ncombinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this \nsurvey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and \nclassify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e., \nSFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or \njust subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons \namong four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and \nOmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In \nequilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods \nare able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on \nLD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a \nsingle sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is \nelevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null \nhypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is \nused instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of \ndetecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In \nterms of execution time, LD-based methods are typically faster than SFS-based \nmethods, due to the nature of required arithmetic."]}

Using \na dual luciferase reporter assay, we found that transfection of cells with a \nplasmid encoding RPL4 cDNA increases recoding efficiency in a dose-dependent \nmanner, with a maximal enhancement of nearly twofold. Expression of RPL4 \nincreases recoding of reporters containing retroviral readthrough and frameshift \nsequences, as well as the Sindbis virus leaky termination signal. RPL4-induced \nenhancement of recoding is cell line specific and appears to be specific to RPL4 \namong ribosomal proteins. Cotransfection of RPL4 cDNA with Moloney murine \nleukemia proviral DNA results in Gag processing defects and a reduction of viral \nparticle formation, presumably caused by the RPL4-dependent alteration of the \nGag-to-Gag-Pol ratio required for virion assembly and release.","Belzutifan (Welireg\u2122) is an oral small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible \nfactor (HIF)-2\u03b1 being developed by Peloton Therapeutics for the treatment of \nsolid tumours, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cell histology \n(ccRCC) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated RCC.

{"input":"Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?","actual_output":"No, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer.","retrieval_context":["Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability \nin cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of \nfocal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors. \nHowever, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial \ncancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype, \nwhereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient \nto explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24, \nmostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations \nin the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events \nand many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to \ncalculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon \nadenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas \nmapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions \nin response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded \nDNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the \nrepair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed \nSNS mutator phenotype.","Inhibition of an initiating oncogene often leads to extensive tumour cell death, \na phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. This has led to the search for \ncompounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. \nHowever, there has been no systematic exploration of whether chromosomal \ninstability generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint \npathway, a frequent characteristic of solid tumours, has any effect on oncogene \naddiction. Here we show that induction of chromosome instability by \noverexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 in mice does not affect the \nregression of Kras-driven lung tumours when Kras is inhibited. However, tumours \nthat experience transient Mad2 overexpression and consequent chromosome \ninstability recur at markedly elevated rates. The recurrent tumours are highly \naneuploid and have varied activation of pro-proliferative pathways. Thus, early \nchromosomal instability may be responsible for tumour relapse after seemingly \neffective anticancer treatments.","Cancer is a multistep process whereby genetic events that result in the \nactivation of proto-oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes \nusurp physiologic programs mandating relentless proliferation and growth. \nExperimental evidence surprisingly illustrates that the inactivation of even a \nsingle oncogene can be sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression. These \nobservations suggest the hypothesis that tumors become irrevocably addicted to \nthe oncogenes that initiated tumorigenesis. The proposed explanation for this \nphenomenon is that activated oncogenes result in a signaling state in which the \nsudden abatement of oncogene activity balances towards proliferative arrest and \napoptosis. Indeed, substantial evidence supports this hypothesis. Here, we \npropose an alternative, although not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanation \nfor how oncogenes initiate and sustain tumorigenesis. We suggest that oncogene \nactivation initiates tumorigenesis precisely because it directly overrides \nphysiologic programs inducing a state of cellular amnesia, not only inducing \nrelentless cellular proliferation, but also bypassing checkpoint mechanisms that \nare essential for cellular mortality, self-renewal, and genomic integrity. \nBecause no single oncogenic lesion is sufficient to overcome all of these \nphysiologic barriers, oncogenes are restrained from inducing tumorigenesis. \nCorrespondingly, in a tumor that has acquired the complete complement of \noncogenic lesions required to overcome all of these safety mechanisms, the \ninactivation of a single oncogene can restore some of these pathways resulting \nin proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and\/or apoptosis. \nThus, oncogenes induce cancer because they induce a cellular state of enforced \noncogenic amnesia in which, only upon oncogene inactivation, the tumor becomes \naware of its transgression."]}

We demonstrate that \nSTAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN \npromoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-\/-) or \nTsc2(-\/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling.

Overall, we identified 15 mutations, 8 of which were novel: \n11 mutations (28.9\u00a0%) were in the MFN2 gene, 2 (5.3\u00a0%) in MPZ and 2 (5.3\u00a0%) in \nPMP22. No mutations were found in GJB1. Two patients showed rearrangements in \nthe PMP22 gene, which is commonly associated with CMT1 or HNPP phenotypes thus \nusually not tested in CMT2 patients. By including this gene in the analysis, we \nreached a molecular diagnosis rate of 39.5\u00a0%, which is one of the highest \nreported in the literature. Our findings confirm the MFN2 gene as the most \ncommon cause of CMT2 and suggest that PMP22 rearrangements should be considered \nin the molecular diagnosis of CMT2 patients.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous \ngroup of disorders and is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, with \nan estimated overall prevalence of 17-40\/10,000. Although there has been major \nadvances in the understanding of the genetic basis of CMT in recent years, the \nmost useful classification is still a neurophysiological classification that \ndivides CMT into type 1 (demyelinating; median motor conduction velocity < 38 \nm\/s) and type 2 (axonal; median motor conduction velocity > 38 m\/s). An \nintermediate type is also increasingly being described. Inheritance can be \nautosomal-dominant (AD), X-linked, or autosomal-recessive (AR). AD CMT1 is the \nmost common type of CMT and was the first form of CMT in which a causative gene \nwas described. This review provides an up-to-date overview of AD CMT1 \nconcentrating on the molecular genetics as the clinical, neurophysiological, and \npathological features have been covered elsewhere. Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, \nLITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI \nand a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also \ncause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria). Studies have shown many of these \ngenes, when mutated, can cause a wide range of CMT phenotypes from the \nrelatively mild CMT1 to the more severe Dejerine-Sottas disease and congenital \nhypomyelinating neuropathy, and even in some cases axonal CMT2. This review \ndiscusses what is known about these genes and in particular how they cause a \nperipheral neuropathy, when mutated.","INTRODUCTION: Most cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease are caused by \nmutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22), including \nheterozygous duplications (CMT1A), deletions (HNPP), and point mutations \n(CMT1E).\nMETHODS: Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to study PMP22 \nmutations based on the results of multiplex ligation-dependent probe \namplification (MLPA) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length \npolymorphism methods in 77 Chinese Han families with CMT1. PMP22 sequencing was \nperformed in MLPA-negative probands. Clinical characteristics were collected for \nall CMT1A\/HNPP probands and their family members.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one of 77 CMT1 probands (27.3%) carried duplication\/deletion \n(dup\/del) copynumber variants. No point mutations were detected. SNP array and \nMLPA seem to have similar sensitivity. Fifty-seven patients from 19 CMT1A \nfamilies had the classical CMT phenotype, except for 1 with concomitant CIDP. \nTwo HNPP probands presented with acute ulnar nerve palsy or recurrent sural \nnerve palsy, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The SNP array has wide coverage, high sensitivity, and high \nresolution and can be used as a screening tool to detect PMP22 dup\/del as shown \nin this Chinese Han population."]}

Both TRalpha2 +\/- and -\/- \nmice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have \ninappropriately normal levels of TSH.

Initially, Regeneron entered into a \njoint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment \nof rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of \nphase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited \nbenefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from \nthe Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two \ncryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial \ncold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \nfor children and adults 12 years and older.

The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1\u03b1 and \ninterleukin-1\u03b2 cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial \ninvolving patients with recurrent pericarditis.\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven, \nrandomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of \nrecurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic \ninflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients \npresenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were \nenrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and \nbackground medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response \n(i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio \nto receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered \nsubcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox \nproportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence. \nSafety was also assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 86 patients with pericarditis pain and an elevated CRP level \nwere enrolled in the run-in period. During the run-in period, the median time to \nresolution or near-resolution of pain was 5 days, and the median time to \nnormalization of the CRP level was 7 days. A total of 61 patients underwent \nrandomization. During the randomized-withdrawal period, there were too few \nrecurrence events in the rilonacept group to allow for the median time to the \nfirst adjudicated recurrence to be calculated; the median time to the first \nadjudicated recurrence in the placebo group was 8.6 weeks (95% confidence \ninterval [CI], 4.0 to 11.7; hazard ratio in a Cox proportional-hazards model, \n0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). During this period, 2 \nof 30 patients (7%) in the rilonacept group had a pericarditis recurrence, as \ncompared with 23 of 31 patients (74%) in the placebo group. In the run-in \nperiod, 4 patients had adverse events leading to the discontinuation of \nrilonacept therapy. The most common adverse events with rilonacept were \ninjection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept led to rapid \nresolution of recurrent pericarditis episodes and to a significantly lower risk \nof pericarditis recurrence than placebo.

RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly \neffective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features. \nCurrently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept \nis another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial \nRHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these \nthree agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical \ntrials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being \ncanakinumab a specific IL-1\u00df antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are \nunselective IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u00df blockers. To date, there is no evidence that \nspecificity against IL-1\u00df affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing \npericarditis, although it has been proposed that unspecific blockage might be \nuseful in severe disease. Anakinra is the first anti-IL-1 agent with \nwell-documented efficacy and safety in adult and pediatric patients with \nidiopathic relapsing pericarditis. Other anti-IL-1 agents are currently under \nstudy. Future research should clarify the optimal duration of therapy and \ntapering schedule of treatment with these agents. Moreover, biomarkers would be \nrequired to understand which patients will benefit from early administration of \nIL-1 blockers due to refractoriness to conventional therapy and which others \nwill suffer from recurrences during the tapering of these agents.

In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates \nalpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 \npromotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated \ndeacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Our results show \nthat HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provide evidence that reversible \nacetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism \nand gene transcription.","Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell \nmorphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and \nformation of cell polarity.

H3K79 was dimethylated in a \nregion containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating \nDNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator \nthat could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme \nresponsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication \nalthough most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the \nabsence of methylated H3K79.

In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the \ntreatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the \nmultinational, phase\u00a0III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are \nongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial \nlipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of \nvolanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult \npatients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in \nwhom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.","Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially \n2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer, \nwhich was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class \ntreatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial \nchylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution, \nmetabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats, \nmonkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies. This \nalso included the characterization of all of the observed ASO metabolite species \nexcreted in urine. Volanesorsen is highly bound to plasma proteins that are \nsimilar in mice, monkeys, and humans. In all species, plasma concentrations \ndeclined in a multiphasic fashion, characterized by a relatively fast initial \ndistribution phase and then a much slower terminal elimination phase following \nsubcutaneous bolus administration. The plasma metabolite profiles of \nvolanesorsen are similar across species, with volanesorsen as the major \ncomponent. Various shortened oligonucleotide metabolites (5-19 nucleotides long) \nwere identified in tissues in the multiple-dose mouse and monkey studies, but \nfewer in the [3H]-volanesorsen rat study, likely due to a lower accumulation of \nmetabolites following a single dose in rats. In urine, all metabolites \nidentified in tissues were observed, consistent with both endo- and \nexonuclease-mediated metabolism and urinary excretion being the major \nelimination pathway for volanesorsen and its metabolites.

There are no effective \ntherapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, \nantisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic APOC3 mRNA with volanesorsen led to \ndecreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels.\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to \nevaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with \nfamilial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 \nratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the \npercentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma \napolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, \ncorresponding to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo \nhad an increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 \nmg per deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving \nvolanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a \nmean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence \ninterval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), \nwhereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride \nlevels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per \nliter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter]) \n(P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as \ncompared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of \nless than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 \npatients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of \nthe patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo \ngroup had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 \npatients in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including 2 who had levels \nbelow 25,000 per microliter.

Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n(RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 \nof the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in \nthe majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE \ngradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions \nof culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of \nseven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were \nproduced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were \nproduced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times \nthat of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were \nequivalent.

A subline of A549 cells that was \nadapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed \nA549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. \nUsing either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and \nGRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for \nBLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and\/or receptor \nsubtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially \nrecognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in \nthe BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The \n2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that \nshowed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against \nthe 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), \ncompared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and \nNMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and \nGRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and \nexpression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and \nexpression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be \ntargeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and \nGRP.","Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the \nbombesin (BB)-family of peptides.

In pulmonary \ncarcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP \nlevels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor \nligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from \nthe carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction \nmarker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different \nreceptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels. The combined \npresence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine \nor autocrine growth loop in carcinoids."]}
{"input":"Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?","actual_output":"The mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure are between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).","retrieval_context":["A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962 \nexplained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different \nbacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The \ntheory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is \nnot random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine \ncontent of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral \nparts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA \nsequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of \nneutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined \nparameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants \nwere discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all \norganisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers \nplausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine \ncontent among different parts of the vertebrate genome.","When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of \nDNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six \n(type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is \nexpected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C \ncontent of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the \nparity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result \nmostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two \nstrands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for \nevaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional \nmutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational \nbiases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias \nmutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional \nselection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis \nshows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of \nfour-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C \ncontent of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly \ncounteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C \ncontent.","Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the \neffect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of \nsubstitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under \nvarious degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts \nthat when the mutational bias between A\/T and G\/C nucleotide pairs is \nequilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the \nmutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately \nafter the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide \nvariation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also \nthe wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of \nmulticellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that \nare not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field \nof molecular evolution, including belief in a constant rate of evolution, \nsymmetric branching of phylogenetic trees, the generality of higher mutation \nfrequency for neutral sets of nucleotides, the notion that mutator mutations are \ngenerally deleterious because of their high mutation rates, and teleological \nexplanations of DNA base composition."]}

However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects \nof EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, \nwe report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro \nand that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent \nendocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2 \nsignaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to \nthe recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin \n(IL)-1\u03b2, pro-IL-18, and gasdermin-D by activated caspase-1 resulted in the \ncellular release of the mature cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and induction of \npyroptosis. Consistent with this result, a dose-dependent cytokine response was \ndetected in the extracellular fluids of mice challenged intraperitoneally with \nS. aureus EVs. Pore-forming toxins associated with S. aureus EVs were critical \nfor NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation of human macrophages, but not for TLR2 \nsignaling.

Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo \nand function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained \nfrom bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have \nbeen less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological \nchallenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic \nextracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we \npresent a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human \nbody fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of \nultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient \ncentrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in \nstool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in \nblood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool; \nand low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), \nchylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free, \nmaintains the integrity of BEVs and ensures reproducibility through the use of \nautomated liquid handlers. Post-separation BEVs are characterized using \northogonal biochemical endotoxin and Toll-like receptor-based reporter assays in \ncombination with proteomics, electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking \nanalysis (NTA) to evaluate BEV quality, abundance, structure and molecular \ncargo. Separation and characterization of BEVs from body fluids can be done \nwithin 72 h, is compatible with EEV analysis and can be readily adopted by \nresearchers experienced in basic molecular biology and extracellular vesicle \nanalysis.

Although essential for the ability to cope with \ndeleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not \nfully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is \ncritical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK \ncatalytic \u03b1-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique \nfunctions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links \nbetween AMPK-\u03b1 isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG \nassociation of AMPK-\u03b12, but not AMPK-\u03b11. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK \nactivity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered \nwith SG formation. Second, AMPK-\u03b1 knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative \nSG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, \noverexpression of mutant \u03b1-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG \nparameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-\u03b12 \nbinding partner. This interaction is stimulated by stress and notably occurs in \nSGs.

We report an unanticipated link \nbetween stress granules and the serine\/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast \ncells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding \nprotein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The \nRSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the \nprion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in \nresponse to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits \nits nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal \ndomain. Nuclear accumulation is dependent on TIA-1. Surprisingly, nuclear \nlocalization of RSK2 is sufficient to enhance proliferation through induction of \ncyclin D1, in the absence of other active signaling pathways. Hence, RSK2 is a \npivotal factor linking the stress response to survival and proliferation.","The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates \nnutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth.

Upon \nheat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to \nSGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat \nstress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly, \nsuggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during \nrecovery from heat stress.

Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG \nresulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence, \nwhereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG. \nThese observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved \nmechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.","Lipin 2 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) responsible for the penultimate \nstep of triglyceride synthesis and dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) \nto generate diacylglycerol. The lipin family of PA phosphatases is composed of \nlipins 1-3, which are members of the conserved haloacid dehalogenase \nsuperfamily. Although genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause \nMajeed syndrome, little is known about the biochemical regulation of its PAP \nactivity. Here, in an attempt to gain a better general understanding of the \nbiochemical nature of lipin 2, we have performed kinetic and phosphorylation \nanalyses. We provide evidence that lipin 2, like lipin 1, binds PA via the \nelectrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism but has a lower rate of catalysis. \nLike lipin 1, lipin 2 is highly phosphorylated, and we identified 15 \nphosphosites. However, unlike lipin 1, the phosphorylation of lipin 2 is not \ninduced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian \ntarget of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively \nregulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2 \nfunctions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the \nhigh degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of \nlipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin \nfamily functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an \nexample of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector \nproteins.","PolyA polymerase (PAP) adds a polyA tail onto the 3'-end of RNAs without a \nnucleic acid template, using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) as a substrate.

As a component of the \nE3 for neddylation, SCCRO\/DCUN1D1 plays a key regulatory role in neddylation \nand, consequently, cullin-RING ligase activity. The essential contribution of \nSCCRO to neddylation is to promote nuclear translocation of the cullin-ROC1 \ncomplex. The presence of a myristoyl sequence in SCCRO3, one of four SCCRO \nparalogues present in humans that localizes to the membrane, raises questions \nabout its function in neddylation. We found that although SCCRO3 binds to CAND1, \ncullins, and ROC1, it does not efficiently bind to Ubc12, promote cullin \nneddylation, or conform to the reaction processivity paradigms, suggesting that \nSCCRO3 does not have E3 activity. Expression of SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO-promoted \nneddylation by sequestering cullins to the membrane, thereby blocking its \nnuclear translocation. Moreover, SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO transforming activity. \nThe inhibitory effects of SCCRO3 on SCCRO-promoted neddylation and \ntransformation require both an intact myristoyl sequence and PONY domain, \nconfirming that membrane localization and binding to cullins are required for in \nvivo functions.

The primary outcome was the time until a \n2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 \nClinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function \nand 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was \ncompared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We \nalso compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two \ngroups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more \nthan 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks).\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy \npopulation. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score \nwas not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. \nThe mean (\u00b1SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per \n48-week period was 0.27\u00b10.35 points in treated patients and 2.12\u00b10.98 points in \n42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events \nincluded convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure \nof the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the \nintraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required \nantibiotic treatment and device replacement.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 \ndisease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in \nhistorical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the \nintraventricular device and device-related infections. (Funded by BioMarin \nPharmaceutical and others; CLN2 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01907087 and \nNCT02485899 .).","Treatment with intracerebroventricular (ICV)-delivered cerliponase alfa enzyme \nreplacement therapy (ERT) in a Phase 1\/2 study of 24 subjects with CLN2 disease \nresulted in a meaningful preservation of motor and language (ML) function and \nwas well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA) \nproduction in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6\/24 (25%) and in the serum of \n19\/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of \n96.4\u202fweeks (range 0.1-129\u202fweeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not \ndetected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were \nreported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E \nwas associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse \nevents. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score. \nTherefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not \npredictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome."]}

{"input":"Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?","actual_output":"The paralog of yeast UPC2 is the YLR228c gene product. This is inferred from the text stating that the YLR228c gene product is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins.","retrieval_context":["The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is \ncrucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens \nsuch as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription \nfactors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression \nof either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking \nboth ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively \ncontrol the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These \ngenes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is \nupregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22\/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, \nergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also \nincreases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors \nSut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control \nof the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12 \nbecomes activated and reduces SUT1\/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in \nincreased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of \nFHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in \ncombination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the \ntransition to filamentous growth.","Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important \nregulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans. \nTo better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location \nprofiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. A triple \nhemagglutinin epitope, introduced at the C terminus of Upc2p, conferred a \ngain-of-function effect on the fusion protein. Location profiling identified 202 \nbound promoters (P < 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose \npromoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol \nbiosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal \nsubunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters \n(CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2, \nSUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, \nSAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to \nthe DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p \nbinding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding \ncorrelates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11, \nMDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1 \ntranscripts in wild-type and upc2Delta\/upc2Delta strains grown under \nUpc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p \nregulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a \nrepressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken \ntogether, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol \nmetabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by \nregulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to \nergosterol biosynthesis genes.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally will not take up sterols from the environment \nunder aerobic conditions. A specific mutant, upc2-1, of the predicted \ntranscriptional activator UPC2 (YDR213w) has been recognized as a strain that \nallows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional \nactivator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at \nthe carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two \nproteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the \nYLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2. \nFirst, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various \nUPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in \nnonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping \nfunction. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was \nduplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using \nsite-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an \nincrease in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The \ncombination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic \nsterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy \nvector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

This adherence event, which initiates the extravasation of \nthe lymphocyte, is highly specific in terms of the class of lymphocyte and the \nanatomic location of the HEV. We review evidence that the lymphocyte adhesive \nmolecule ('homing receptor') involved in attachment to PN HEV is a \ncarbohydrate-binding receptor (lectin-like) with specificity for \nmannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-like ligands. We describe the use of a novel \ncytochemical probe for the detection and characterization of cell surface \ncarbohydrate-binding receptors.

Later their proportion decreases \nto reach the low values seen in adulthood. Most DP T cells are small size \nlymphocytes that do not exhibit an activated phenotype, and their proliferative \nrate is similar to that of the other peripheral T cell subpopulations. Only \n30-40% of DP T cells expresses CD8beta chain, the remaining cells expressing \nCD8alphaalpha homodimers. However, both DP T cell subsets have an intrathymic \norigin since they appear in the recent thymic emigrant population after \ninjection of FITC intrathymically. Functionally, although DP T cells are \nresistant to undergo apoptosis in response to glucocorticoids, they show poor \nproliferative responses upon CD3\/TCR stimulation due to their inability to \nproduce IL-2. A fraction of DP T cells are not actively synthesizing the CD8 \ncoreceptor, and they gradually differentiate to the CD4 cell lineage in \nreaggregation cultures. Transfer of DP T lymphocytes into thymectomized SCID \nmice demonstrates that these cells undergo post-thymic maturation in the \nperipheral lymphoid organs and that their CD4 cell progeny is fully \nimmunocompetent, as judged by its ability to survive and expand in peripheral \nlymphoid organs, to proliferate in response to CD3 ligation, and to produce IL-2 \nupon stimulation.","Hemopoietic cells from blood and bone marrow of mammals usually do not express \nlamins A\/C but only lamin B, and this feature distinguishes these cells from the \nvast majority of somatic cells of the adult animal, which reveal lamins A\/C as \nwell as lamin B.

J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.","BACKGROUND: After tooth loss, the posterior maxilla is usually characterized by \nlimited bone height secondary to pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and\/or \ncollapse of the alveolar ridge that preclude in many instances the installation \nof dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several \ntreatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the \ninstallation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting \nmaterials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless, \nmembrane perforations represent the most common complication among these \nprocedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the \nrelevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed \nby two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, \nand Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018 \nreporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without \nregenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft \nmaterial. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant \nplacement, with and without punch out Schneiderian.

The level of implant penetration (\u2264\u20094\u2009mm or \n>\u20094\u2009mm) did not report statistically significant differences in survival rate \n(p\u2009=\u20090.403). Seven studies provided information on the rate of clinical \ncomplications, being the mean complication rate 3.4% (IC 95%). The most frequent \nclinical complication was epistaxis, without finding significant differences \naccording to the level of penetration. Five studies provide information on the \nradiographic complication; the most common complication was thickening of the \nSchneiderian membrane. The weighted complication rate was 14.8% (IC 95%), and \npenetration level affects the rate of radiological complications, being these of \n5.29% in implant penetrating \u22644\u2009mm and 29.3% in implant penetrating >\u20094\u2009mm, \nwithout reaching statistical significant difference (p\u2009=\u20090.301).\nCONCLUSION: The overall survival rate of the implants into the sinus cavity was \n95.6%, without statistical differences according to the level of penetration. \nThe clinical and radiological complications were 3.4% and 14.8% respectively. \nThe most frequent clinical complication was the epistaxis, and the radiological \ncomplication was thickening of the Schneiderian membrane, without reaching \nstatistical significant difference according to the level of implant penetration \ninside the sinus.","Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in \northopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these \nimplants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still \nexist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called \nosseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of \ndrugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could \neither impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and \nanti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic \nbone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, \nprostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate; \nanti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin, \nbiphosphonates, RANK\/RANKL\/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators \n(SERM). Examples of the new therapies include DKK1- and anti-sclerostin \nantibodies. All classes of treatments have proven to possess positive impacts \nsuch as an increase in bone mineral density and on osseointegration. In order to \nprevent complications from occurring after surgery, some post-operative systemic \ndrugs are administered; these can show an impairment in the osseointegration \nprocess. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump \ninhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The effects of aspirin, \nacetaminophen, opioids, adjuvants, anticoagulants and antibiotics in implant \nfixations are not fully understood, but studies are being carried out to \ninvestigate potential ramifications.

Moreover, the quality of western blot data is \nsometimes challenged due to a lack of effective quality control tools in place \nthroughout the western blotting process. Here we describe the V3 western \nworkflow, which applies stain-free technology to address the major concerns \nassociated with the traditional western blot protocol. This workflow allows \nresearchers: 1) to run a gel in about 20-30 min; 2) to visualize sample \nseparation quality within 5 min after the gel run; 3) to transfer proteins in \n3-10 min; 4) to verify transfer efficiency quantitatively; and most importantly \n5) to validate changes in the level of the protein of interest using total \nprotein loading control. This novel approach eliminates the need of stripping \nand reprobing the blot for housekeeping proteins such as \u03b2-actin, \u03b2-tubulin, \nGAPDH, etc. The V3 stain-free workflow makes the western blot process faster, \ntransparent, more quantitative\u00a0and reliable.","In Western blotting, a suitable loading control is indispensable for correcting \nerrors in the total amount of loaded protein.

Direct Blue 71 (DB71) staining-a novel, sensitive, dye-binding \nstaining method compatible with immunodetection-may offer advantages over these \ntraditional loading control methods. Three common neuroscientific samples (human \nplasma, human oligodendrocytes, and rat brain) were employed to assess DB71 \nstaining as a loading control method for Western blotting. DB71, CBB, one \ntraditional housekeeping protein, and one protein of interest were comparatively \nassessed for reliability and repeatability and linear dynamic range over 2.5-40 \n\u03bcg of protein loaded. DB71's effect on the reliability and repeatability and \nlinear dynamic range of immunoreaction were also assessed. Across all three \nsample types, DB71 was either equivalent or superior to CBB and housekeeping \nprotein-based methods in terms of reliability and repeatability and linear \ndynamic range. Across all three sample types, DB71 staining did not impair the \nreliability and repeatability or linear dynamic range of immunoreaction.

Although \nthe search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on \nfor about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based \non our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions \nto predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between \nour approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal \nDNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of \npyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., \nYYRR versus RYRY); (iii) we postulate that alternating AT-rich and GC-rich \nmotifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and DNA \nin the minor groove. Using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions \nmapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, \nthe pGUB plasmid, chicken beta-globin and three 5S rDNA genes). We predicted 15 \nof the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. \nThe predicted position of the '601' nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the \ncomputed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by \nno more than 1 bp - an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. Our \nanalysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be \ndivided into two groups based on the positioning 'rules' they follow. The \nsequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable YR\/YYRR motifs at the \nminor-groove bending sites SHL+\/- 3.5 and +\/- 5.5, which is similar to the \nalpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes.

In the other group \n(that includes the '601' clone) the same YR\/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at \nthe sites SHL +\/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3\/H4 tetramer and the \ncentral part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the \npositioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these \nnucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the \nstereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either \nan X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of \nnucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring \npredominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA).

This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and \nespecially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a \nconsequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major \ndeterminant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show \nthat data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched \ncontrol experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.","Nucleosomes form the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, and \nprevious attempts to understand the principles governing their genome-wide \ndistribution have spurred much interest and debate in biology. In particular, \nthe precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been \ncontroversial. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of \nhitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5\u2009bp periodicity, \nand poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome \nlandscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our \ncomputational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and \nnucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to \nother previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo \nnucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content \nis the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase \ndigestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, \npoly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the \nexperimental method used. We further show that the 10.5\u2009bp nucleotide \nperiodicity facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying \nour method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, \nthe regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites \ncan be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone. Finally, in vivo \nnucleosome occupancy derived from MNase-seq experiments around transcription \ntermination sites can be mostly explained by the genomic sequence. Implications \nof these results and potential extensions of the proposed computational \nframework are discussed."]}

The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time.

{"input":"Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?","actual_output":"The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.","retrieval_context":["Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the \nresistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the \nsusceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). \nIn SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. \nMurine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous \nlupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes \nSLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted \nTLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic \ncells (pDC), monocytes\/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes \nsingle-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the \nproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each \ncell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage \nwith XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome \ninactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously.

TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and \nwe examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome \ninactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. \nSingle-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial \nfractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells \nnot only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X \nchromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 \ntranscriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher \nTLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations.

NELL1\/2 binds to the first fibronectin \ntype III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2.

The Robo2 deletion mutants without the \nfourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can \ninfluence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1\/2. \nAcidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These \nresults suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1\/2, particularly \nunder circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion. If this is not \nthe case, conformational changes of the ectodomain of Robo2 may unmask the \nbinding site for NELL1\/2.","The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate \nmidline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous \nsystem (CNS).

While previous studies have \ninvestigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five \nImmunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the \nthree evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have \nindividually deleted each of Drosophila Robo1's three Fn repeats, and then \ntested these Robo1 variants in vitro to determine their ability to bind Slit in \ncultured Drosophila cells and in vivo to investigate the requirement for each \ndomain in regulating Robo1's embryonic expression pattern, axonal localization, \nmidline repulsive function, and sensitivity to Commissureless (Comm) \ndownregulation. We demonstrate that the Fn repeats are not required for Robo1 to \nbind Slit or for proper expression of Robo1 in Drosophila embryonic neurons. \nWhen expressed in a robo1 mutant background, these variants are able to restore \nmidline repulsion to an extent equivalent to full-length Robo1. We identify a \nnovel requirement for Fn3 in the exclusion of Robo1 from commissures and \ndownregulation of Robo1 by Comm.

We \nevaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src\/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib \n(AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell \nlines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, \nsaracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration\/invasion of SNU216 \nand NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src\/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic \nsignaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and \nNCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family \nmember Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by \ntreatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in \nsaracatinib-induced apoptosis.

Furthermore, combined \ntreatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted \nsynergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant \ncells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and \n5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts.

Additionally, saracatinib \nsignificantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in \nHeLa\/v200 and MCF-7\/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells. \nFurthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited \nphotolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a \nconcentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the \nbinding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding \ncavity of human ABCB1.

Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated \nthat CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent \ndisease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly, \nabiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets, \nwhich dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile. Besides CYP17 \ninhibition, abiraterone acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and \ninhibits 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase--two effects that potentially \ncontribute to its antitumour effects. However, the inhibition of the \n17\u03b1-hydroxylase activity of CYP17, CYP11B1 and a panel of hepatic CYP enzymes \nleads to adverse effects and toxicities that include secondary mineralocorticoid \nexcess. Abiraterone is also associated with increased incidence of cardiac \ndisorders. Under such circumstances, development of new CYP17 inhibitors as an \nadditional line of defence is urgently needed. To achieve enhanced clinical \nbenefits, new strategies are being explored that include selective inhibition of \nthe C17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 and multi-targeting strategies that affect \nandrogen synthesis and signalling at different points.

Residual tumor \nandrogens and androgen axis activation are now recognized to play a prominent \nrole in mediating CRPC progression. Despite suppression of circulating \ntestosterone to castrate levels, castration does not eliminate androgens from \nthe prostate tumor microenvironment and residual androgen levels are well within \nthe range capable of activating the androgen receptor (AR) and AR-mediated gene \nexpression.

RQ is a measure of the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed, and a lower RQ indicates a shift from carbohydrate to lipid utilization. Additionally, the treatment of T(1)AM caused ketonuria and a significant loss of body fat, which further supports the idea that thyronamines have effects on fat tissue.","retrieval_context":["Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone. \nSystemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a \nlesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia, \ndecreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia.

In addition to \nphosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine \nacetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of \nS6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly \nconserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516 \nantibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently \ninduced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and \nphosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events \nappear to be functionally independent.

Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 \nand p300\/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated \nby p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing \np300.

In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased \nphosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the \nLST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since \nLST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and \nmTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be \nreduced by over-expression of the Cterminally deleted Raptor mutant (Raptor-\u0394CT) \nnot binding to mTOR or LST8, while phosphorylation levels of Akt were markedly \nenhanced with no alteration in IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity. \nUsing Raptor-\u0394CT, we investigated the competition for association with LST8 \nbetween mTORC1 and mTORC2.

The \ngovernment has given HTA an important place within health care in the United \nKingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The \nassessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening \nCommittee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all \nbeen assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of \nmammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by \na rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In \nthe case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded \nthat screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has \nbeen accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been \nassessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is \ndifficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical \npractice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the \nfrequency of screening.\nCONCLUSION: HTA and the assessment of screening are well established in the \nUnited Kingdom. Policy is generally based on the assessments done, and practice \ngenerally follows the results of assessment. Assessment of screening is expected \nto become increasingly important in the United Kingdom during the next years.","OBJECTIVES: To review evidence regarding the potential introduction of prostate \ncancer screening programmes and highlight issues pertinent to the management of \nscreen-detected prostate cancer.\nMETHODS: Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial health care issue in \ngeneral and urological practice. A PubMed database search was performed, \nfollowed by a systematic review of the literature, to examine the evidence base \nunderlying prostate cancer screening.\nRESULTS: A prostate cancer screening programme should satisfy several key \npostulates prior to its introduction. To date, several of these postulates have \nnot been satisfied, and the evidence available for prostate cancer screening is \ncurrently insufficient to warrant its introduction as a public health policy. \nThe natural history of screen-detected prostate cancer remains poorly \nunderstood, and recent evidence suggests that a screening programme may detect a \nlarge number of men with indolent disease who may be subsequently overtreated. \nSeveral randomised clinical trials are currently in progress and it is hoped \nthat they will provide robust evidence to inform future practice.\nCONCLUSIONS: National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside \nrandomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to \nlack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and\/or \nquality of life in men with screen-detected disease. Forthcoming results of \nclinical trials and the application of appropriate risk stratification to \nprevent overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer are likely to change practice \nin coming years."]}

We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate \napproximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have \nshort half-lives of two to three generations.

This is suggested by the pieces of information provided, which indicate that high glucose conditions can lead to increased intracellular calcium levels, which in turn can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. This calcium overload is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes.","retrieval_context":["Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in \nmyocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal \nintracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and \nmay precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that \ndiabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic \nreticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. \nImportantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in \ndiabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired \nendothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric \noxide (NO), elevated cell adhesion molecules, and decreased angiogenic growth \nfactors.

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional \n\"antagonist\" and \"agonist\" mechanisms.

Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged \nstudies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach \nin cancer and fungal infections."]}
{"input":"Is colistin an antibiotic?","actual_output":"Yes, colistin is an antibiotic. It belongs to the polymyxin family of antibiotics and is used to treat infections caused by certain Gram-negative bacteria.","retrieval_context":["BACKGROUND: The emergence of bacterial drug resistance encourages the \nre-evaluation of the potential of existing antimicrobials. Lantibiotics are \npost-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides \nwith a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Here, we focussed on expanding the \npotential of lacticin 3147, one of the most studied lantibiotics and one which \npossesses potent activity against a wide range of Gram positive species \nincluding many nosocomial pathogens. More specifically, our aim was to \ninvestigate if lacticin 3147 activity could be enhanced when combined with a \nrange of different clinical antibiotics.\nRESULTS: Initial screening revealed that polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) \nexhibited synergistic activity with lacticin 3147. Checkerboard assays were \nperformed against a number of strains, including both Gram positive and Gram \nnegative species. The resultant fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index \nvalues established that, while partial synergy was detected against Gram \npositive targets, synergy was obvious against Gram negative species, including \nCronobacter and E. coli.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combining lacticin 3147 with low levels of a polymyxin could \nprovide a means of broadening target specificity of the lantibiotic, while also \nreducing polymyxin use due to the lower concentrations required as a result of \nsynergy.","Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic \nalkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be \ninduced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only \nanecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated \nwith colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge, \ncolistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in \nthe literature. We here report a-28-week, 740\u00a0g female preterm infant who \ndeveloped BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii \ninfection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the \npossible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin \npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm \ninfants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.","Novel approaches for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative \nbacterial infections are urgently required. One approach is to potentiate the \nefficacy of existing antibiotics whose spectrum of activity is limited by the \npermeability barrier presented by the Gram-negative outer membrane. Cationic \npeptides derived from polymyxin B have been used to permeabilize the outer \nmembrane, granting antibiotics that would otherwise be excluded access to their \ntargets. We assessed the in vitro efficacies of combinations of SPR741 with \nconventional antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and \nAcinetobacter baumannii Of 35 antibiotics tested, the MICs of 8 of them were \nreduced 32- to 8,000-fold against E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the presence of \nSPR741. The eight antibiotics, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, \nfusidic acid, mupirocin, retapamulin, rifampin, and telithromycin, had diverse \ntargets and mechanisms of action. Against A. baumannii, similar potentiation was \nachieved with clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, retapamulin, and \nrifampin. Susceptibility testing of the most effective antibiotic-SPR741 \ncombinations was extended to 25 additional multidrug-resistant or clinical \nisolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae and 17 additional A. baumannii isolates in \norder to rank the potentiated antibiotics. SPR741 was also able to potentiate \nantibiotics that are substrates of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in E. coli, \neffectively circumventing the contribution of this pump to intrinsic antibiotic \nresistance. These studies support the further development of SPR741 in \ncombination with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative \nbacterial infections."]}
