This indicates that aberrant epigenetic events, particularly those involving histone lysine methylation, play a critical role in the development of medulloblastoma.","retrieval_context":["We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and \nloss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors. \nWe found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20 \nknown tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in \nmedulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and \nhomozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal \ngenetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that \nof histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone \nproteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in \ndetermination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. \nConsistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling \nH3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. \nCopy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, \nremoving and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at \nH3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the \npathogenesis of medulloblastoma.","Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain \ntumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To \nassess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify \ncritical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status \nof 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), \nCASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma \ncell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG \nmethylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the \ncerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in \nmedulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41\/44 primary tumours versus \n0\/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a \nsubset of primary tumours (17\/44 and 14\/39) occurred against a consistent \nbackground of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore \nindicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are \ntumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes \nin medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic \ntranscriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following \ntreatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The \nremaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF), \np16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3, \nTP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum \n(EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in \nmedulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation \naffects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a \nconcordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic \nTSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify \nRASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. \nFurthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the \nrequirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the \ntumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.","Recent sequencing efforts have described the mutational landscape of the \npediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Although MLL2 is among the most frequent \nsomatic single nucleotide variants (SNV), the clinical and biological \nsignificance of these mutations remains uncharacterized. Through targeted \nre-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14\/175) of MBs, the \nmajority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations \naffecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7\/175) of tumors. While MLL2 \nmutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or \nmolecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 \nMBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical \nstaining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A \nactivity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % \n(53\/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven \nhistone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved \n(K4+\/K27-) and dismal (K4-\/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and \n4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and \ntranscriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2, \nKDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes.

This has led \nto increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy. \nHere we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and \nan emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer \ncells on its paralog STAG1.

Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely \nlow frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency \ntechnology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has \ngenerated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate \nthe relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of \nthe head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. \nThis publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study.\nMETHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and \ncentral nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. \nEligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly \ndiagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The \ndiagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal \nradiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+\/-5 years) and \nplace of residence.

The statistical \npower of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility \nof an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in \nthe international INTERPHONE analyses.","Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of \nmobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for \nmeningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields \n(RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011 \nRF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study \nwas to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years) \nuse of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We \nconducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged \n18-75 years and diagnosed during 2007-2009. One population-based control matched \non gender and age (within 5 years) was used to each case. Here, we report on \nmalignant cases including all available controls. Exposures on e.g. use of \nmobile phones and cordless phones were assessed by a self-administered \nquestionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed, \nadjusting for age, gender, year of diagnosis and socio-economic index using the \nwhole control sample. Of the cases with a malignant brain tumour, 87% (n=593) \nparticipated, and 85% (n=1,368) of controls in the whole study answered the \nquestionnaire.

With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone \nstudies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the \nSwedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of \nsignificant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An \nanalysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of \na cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious \ndesign flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient \nlatency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young \nadults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power \nlevels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting \nsources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the \ncellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor \ncases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and \n(11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish \nstudies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10). The data from the Swedish studies are \nconsistent with what would be expected if cellphone use were a risk for brain \ntumors, while the Interphone studies data are incredulous.

The clinical syndrome associates dementia, \nparkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is \ncortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or \ndelusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse \nLewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains \nunclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.","Diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies \n(LB) in the neurons and neurites of cortical, subcortical, and brain stem \nstructures. Recently, alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been found to be a central \nconstituent of LB. In DLBD, abnormal accumulation of alphaS has been reported in \nboth neurons and glia, but studies on glial lesions in DLBD have been limited. \nWe examined in detail the constituents and distribution of glial lesions in \neight patients with DLBD and report the pathogenesis of the glial lesions. \nalphaS-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NI), neuropil threads (NT), and \ncoiled bodies (CB) showed similar immunostaining profiles. Without pretreatment, \nNI, NT, and CB were detected by all antibodies against alphaS. The \nimmunostaining profile of star-like astrocytes (SLA) was quite different from \nthose of NI, NT, and CB. A few SLA were stained by an antibody against the \nnon-Abeta component portion of alphaS without pretreatment, but formic acid \npretreatment dramatically enhanced SLA immunoreactivity.

SLA were scarce in the brain stem, but there were \nhundreds of SLA per visual field at x100 magnification in the temporal cortex of \nmost cases, while CB were found diffusely in both the cerebral cortex and brain \nstem, similar to NI. This suggests that the pathogenesis of SLA is different \nfrom those of NI and CB.","Lewy bodies, the characteristic pathological lesion of substantia nigra neurons \nin Parkinson's disease (PD), are frequently observed to accompany the amyloid \nplaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The observation of Lewy bodies in familial AD cases suggests that like \nneurofibrillary tangles, the formation of Lewy bodies can be induced by the \npathological state caused by Abeta-amyloid overproduction. The role of Lewy body \nformation in the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons remains unclear.

It showed an even \nhigher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0\u00b781 (0\u00b777-0\u00b785). The \nNoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0\u00b767 [95% \nCI 0\u00b765-0\u00b769]; p<0\u00b70001) and Berlin (0\u00b763 [0\u00b761-0\u00b766]; p<0\u00b70001) scores.\nINTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement \nscore enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered \nbreathing.

The aim of this study was to assess the \neffectiveness of the NoSAS score in predicting the presence of OSAS among \nparticipants with current MDE and to compare it with the performance of existing \nscreening tools.\nMETHODS: A random sample of the population-based cohort CoLaus (Lausanne, \nSwitzerland) underwent a psychiatric evaluation (PsyCoLaus) and a complete \npolysomnography at home (HypnoLaus). The effectiveness of the NoSAS score in \ndetecting the risk of significant OSAS among current MDE participants was \nassessed and compared with STOP-BANG and Berlin scores.\nRESULTS: Among the 1761 subjects (58,75 \u00b1 11y.o.; 47,8%men) who underwent \npolysomnography, significant OSAS was present in 24.0% with and 26.1% without \ncurrent MDE. Using a threshold of \u2265 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in \nMDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative \npredictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area \nunder the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the \nBerlin score (NS).\nLIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The \nstudied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening \ntools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool \nfor OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.","INTRODUCTION: Screening methods have become increasingly important due to the \ngrowing number of patients suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) \nbeing referred to sleep clinics. The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference, \nObesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily \nemployed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease. \nThe score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if \nthey have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool \nfor the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic.\nMETHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by \nprimary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had \nundergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test \nassigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a \nbody-mass index of 25kg\/m2 to less than 30kg\/m2 or 5 points for having a \nbody-mass index of 30kg\/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being \nolder than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.\nRESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5\u00b112.1 years, with a neck \ncircumference of 41.0\u00b13.6cm and a BMI of 30.8\u00b15.1kg\/m2. OSA was present in 84.0% \nof the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS \nmodel for the prediction of all OSA, moderate\/severe OSA and severe OSA, the \narea under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; \n0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: \n(0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability \nof the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score \u22657, the sensitivity and positive \npredictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for \nmoderate\/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the \nsame cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate\/severe and severe \nOSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was \nassociated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA \nprobability for a score of 17.\nCONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with \nspecificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. \nFurthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of \nmoderate\/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this \nscore can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the \ndiagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy \nof this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a \npredominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease."]}

{"input":"Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?","actual_output":"No, a selective sweep typically results in a local reduction of genetic variation around the adaptive site. However, it can carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele, which can lead to an increase in genetic variation at a broader scale. But overall, a selective sweep generally decreases genetic variation in the immediate vicinity of the adaptive site.","retrieval_context":["A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to \nstrong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the \nbeneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that \nh=1\/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory \nfor selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that \ngenetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance \n0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs. \nMoreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele. \nWe find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until \nfixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of \u221a(N\/s) generations, if N \nis the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic \ndiversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other \ncases.","Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic \ndiversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly \ncarry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early \nin a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay \nbetween mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a \ncharacteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation \nthat depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection \ncoefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator \nfor the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the \nnovel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on \npreexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination. \nCompared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the \nsize of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator \nrequires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture \nlow-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard \napproaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our \nestimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a \nconsequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of \nrecombination, soft sweeps, and demography.

{"input":"Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?","actual_output":"No, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer.","retrieval_context":["Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability \nin cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of \nfocal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors. \nHowever, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial \ncancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype, \nwhereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient \nto explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24, \nmostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations \nin the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events \nand many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to \ncalculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon \nadenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas \nmapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions \nin response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded \nDNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the \nrepair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed \nSNS mutator phenotype.","Inhibition of an initiating oncogene often leads to extensive tumour cell death, \na phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. This has led to the search for \ncompounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. \nHowever, there has been no systematic exploration of whether chromosomal \ninstability generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint \npathway, a frequent characteristic of solid tumours, has any effect on oncogene \naddiction. Here we show that induction of chromosome instability by \noverexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 in mice does not affect the \nregression of Kras-driven lung tumours when Kras is inhibited. However, tumours \nthat experience transient Mad2 overexpression and consequent chromosome \ninstability recur at markedly elevated rates. The recurrent tumours are highly \naneuploid and have varied activation of pro-proliferative pathways. Thus, early \nchromosomal instability may be responsible for tumour relapse after seemingly \neffective anticancer treatments.","Cancer is a multistep process whereby genetic events that result in the \nactivation of proto-oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes \nusurp physiologic programs mandating relentless proliferation and growth. \nExperimental evidence surprisingly illustrates that the inactivation of even a \nsingle oncogene can be sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression. These \nobservations suggest the hypothesis that tumors become irrevocably addicted to \nthe oncogenes that initiated tumorigenesis. The proposed explanation for this \nphenomenon is that activated oncogenes result in a signaling state in which the \nsudden abatement of oncogene activity balances towards proliferative arrest and \napoptosis. Indeed, substantial evidence supports this hypothesis. Here, we \npropose an alternative, although not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanation \nfor how oncogenes initiate and sustain tumorigenesis. We suggest that oncogene \nactivation initiates tumorigenesis precisely because it directly overrides \nphysiologic programs inducing a state of cellular amnesia, not only inducing \nrelentless cellular proliferation, but also bypassing checkpoint mechanisms that \nare essential for cellular mortality, self-renewal, and genomic integrity. \nBecause no single oncogenic lesion is sufficient to overcome all of these \nphysiologic barriers, oncogenes are restrained from inducing tumorigenesis. \nCorrespondingly, in a tumor that has acquired the complete complement of \noncogenic lesions required to overcome all of these safety mechanisms, the \ninactivation of a single oncogene can restore some of these pathways resulting \nin proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and\/or apoptosis. \nThus, oncogenes induce cancer because they induce a cellular state of enforced \noncogenic amnesia in which, only upon oncogene inactivation, the tumor becomes \naware of its transgression."]}

LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely \nexpressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein \ndegradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster, \ndefining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral \nnerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G \nmutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level \nof expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury. \nThis finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause \nCMT1.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1 \npatients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new \nmechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy."]}

However, it is mentioned that TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 are involved in the regulation of KCND2, KCND3, and KCNIP2 genes in rat cardiomyocytes. Since TRalpha2 is a non-hormone-binding variant of TRalpha1, it is possible that TRalpha2 might also indirectly influence the expression of these genes, but this is not directly addressed in the provided context.","retrieval_context":["Thyroid hormone governs a diverse repertoire of physiological functions through \nreceptors encoded in the receptor genes alpha and beta, which each generate \nvariant proteins. In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the \nnormal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact \nfunction is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted \nablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an \ninevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +\/- and -\/- \nmice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have \ninappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild \nmorphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that \nthe genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones. \nHowever, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, \nincluding decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body \ntemperature.

However, it remains unclear whether T3 directly modulates underlying gene \ntranscription and which thyroid receptor (TR) isoform might be responsible for \ngene transactivation. To clarify this situation, we analysed the role of T3 and \nits receptors alpha1 (TRalpha1) and beta1 (TRbeta1) in regulation of KCNA4, \nKCND2, KCND3 and KCNIP2 transcription in rat cardiomyocytes. Initial results \ndemonstrated a T3-mediated increase of I(to) current density. T3 stimulation \nenhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while \nKCNIP2 remained unaffected. To dissect the role of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 in \nT3-dependent I(to) modulation, TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 were overexpressed in \ncardiomyocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. TRalpha1 increased I(to), \nwhile TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with \nTRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2\/3 \ntranscription. To further evaluate a possible direct interaction of TRalpha1 and \nTRbeta1 with the KCND3 promoter, TR expression vectors were cotransfected with a \nconstruct containing 2335 bp of the KCND3 5'-flanking sequence linked to a \nluciferase reporter into ventricular myocytes. While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor \nenhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 \nexpression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 \nstimulation. Deletion of the KCND3 5'-flanking region localized the suppressible \npromoter sequence for TRbeta1 to within -293 bp and the activating promoter \nsequence for TRalpha1 to within -2335 to -1654 bp of the transcription start \nsite. Disruption of putative TR binding sites by mutagenesis abolished the \nTRalpha1- (G-1651T) and TRbeta1- (G-73T) mediated effects, indicating that \nTRalpha1 and TRbeta1 response elements map to different regions of the KCND3 \npromoter. Thus, I(to) is modulated by diverse T3-dependent regulation of \nunderlying gene transcription. TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 exhibit distinct effects on \nKCND3 transactivation with TRalpha1 enhancing and TRbeta1 suppressing KCND3 \ntranscription.","Alterations in TR [thyroid hormone (TH) receptor]1 isoform expression have been \nreported in models of both physiologic and pathologic cardiac hypertrophy as \nwell as in patients with heart failure. In this report, we demonstrate that TH \ninduces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and, \nmoreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a \nhypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and \nTRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and \ninvolves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38. \nMitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate \nTRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and \np38 activities, respectively.

Hepatitis C virus \n(Chapter 70) may be a flavivirus. Alphavirus is one of the two genera in the \nfamily Togaviridae; the other genus (Rubivirus) has rubella virus (Chapter 55) \nas its only member. Flavivirus, once classified in the Togaviridae, now \nconstitutes one of three genera in the family Flaviviridae; the other two genera \nare Pestivirus and \u201cHepatitis C-like viruses\u201d. Pestivirus includes animal \npathogens (bovine viral diarrhea and hog cholera viruses) that are of \nconsiderable economic importance, but contains no known human pathogens. \nHepatitis C virus is described in Chapter 70. All alphaviruses and flaviviruses \nthat cause disease in humans are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In the \noriginal classification scheme based on antigenic relationships, alphaviruses \nand flaviviruses were termed group A and group B arboviruses, respectively. Most \nalphaviruses and flaviviruses survive in nature by replicating alternately in a \nvertebrate host and a hematophagous arthropod (mosquitoes or, for some \nflaviviruses, ticks). Arthropod vectors acquire the viral infection by biting a \nviremic host, and after an extrinsic incubation period during which the virus \nreplicates in the vector's tissues, they transmit virus through salivary \nsecretions to another vertebrate host. Virus replicates in the vertebrate host, \ncausing viremia and sometimes illness. The ability to infect and replicate in \nboth vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and \nflaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of \nwild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do \nnot usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue \nvirus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a \nhuman-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and \ncapable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause \nwidespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential, \nthese viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical \nregions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because \nsome of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious, \nspecial containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required.","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to humans primarily \nthrough the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks. West Nile virus (WNV) is the \nleading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease in the United States. \nHowever, several other arboviruses also cause sporadic cases and seasonal \noutbreaks of neuroinvasive disease (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis, and acute \nflaccid paralysis). This report summarizes surveillance data reported to CDC in \n2013 for WNV and other nationally notifiable arboviruses, excluding dengue. \nForty-seven states and the District of Columbia reported 2,469 cases of WNV \ndisease. Of these, 1,267 (51%) were classified as WNV neuroinvasive disease, for \na national incidence of 0.40 per 100,000 population. After WNV, the next most \ncommonly reported cause of arboviral disease was La Crosse virus (LACV) (85 \ncases), followed by Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), Powassan virus (POWV), and \neastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (eight). WNV and other arboviruses \ncontinue to cause serious illness in substantial numbers of persons annually. \nMaintaining surveillance remains important to help direct and promote prevention \nactivities.","The smallest of all the pathogens, viruses, have continuously been the foremost \nstrange microorganisms. Viral infections can cause extreme sicknesses as \nevidenced by the HIV\/AIDS widespread or the later Ebola or Zika episodes. \nApprehensive framework distortions are also regularly observed as consequences \nof numerous viral infections. Besides, numerous viral infections are of \noncoviruses, which can trigger different types of cancer. Nearly every year, a \nmodern infectious species emerges, debilitating the world population with an \nannihilating episode. Subsequently, there is a need to create antivirals to \ncombat such rising infections. From the discovery of the antiviral drug \nIdoxuridine in 1962 to the revelation of Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) that was \napproved by the FDA in 2018, the whole process and criteria of creating \nantivirals have changed significantly. In this article, different auxiliary \nscience strategies are described that can serve as a referral for therapeutic \ninnovation."]}

Initially, Regeneron entered into a \njoint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment \nof rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of \nphase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited \nbenefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from \nthe Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two \ncryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial \ncold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \nfor children and adults 12 years and older. CAPS is a group of inherited \ninflammatory disorders consisting of FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem \ninflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as chronic infantile neurologic, \ncutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous \nmutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or \ncryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent \nof IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but \nwith limited success.

The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1\u03b1 and \ninterleukin-1\u03b2 cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial \ninvolving patients with recurrent pericarditis.\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven, \nrandomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of \nrecurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic \ninflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients \npresenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were \nenrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and \nbackground medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response \n(i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio \nto receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered \nsubcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox \nproportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence. \nSafety was also assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 86 patients with pericarditis pain and an elevated CRP level \nwere enrolled in the run-in period. During the run-in period, the median time to \nresolution or near-resolution of pain was 5 days, and the median time to \nnormalization of the CRP level was 7 days. A total of 61 patients underwent \nrandomization. During the randomized-withdrawal period, there were too few \nrecurrence events in the rilonacept group to allow for the median time to the \nfirst adjudicated recurrence to be calculated; the median time to the first \nadjudicated recurrence in the placebo group was 8.6 weeks (95% confidence \ninterval [CI], 4.0 to 11.7; hazard ratio in a Cox proportional-hazards model, \n0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). During this period, 2 \nof 30 patients (7%) in the rilonacept group had a pericarditis recurrence, as \ncompared with 23 of 31 patients (74%) in the placebo group. In the run-in \nperiod, 4 patients had adverse events leading to the discontinuation of \nrilonacept therapy. The most common adverse events with rilonacept were \ninjection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept led to rapid \nresolution of recurrent pericarditis episodes and to a significantly lower risk \nof pericarditis recurrence than placebo.

CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of \ninterleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of \nfunction mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is \nsupported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1\u03b2 blockade in these conditions. \nRilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug \nAdministration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome \nand Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for \nlonger-acting IL-1 blockade.

However, the enzymes \nresponsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. \nHere we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions \nas a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where \nit associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex \ncontaining p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a \nglobal deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases \nalpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates \nalpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 \npromotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated \ndeacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Our results show \nthat HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provide evidence that reversible \nacetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism \nand gene transcription.","Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition \nfrom preadipocytes to mature adipocytes.

Moreover, acetylation of \n\u03b1-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases \nSIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is \ninhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing \ncells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with \nenhanced activity on acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. \nWe propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation initiates \ncytoskeleton remodelling by promoting \u03b1-tubulin severing by katanin which, in \nturn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological \ntransition toward mature adipocytes.","Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell \nmorphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and \nformation of cell polarity.

Microtubules are subject to various covalent \nmodifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated \nwith stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans.

Although \nligno-cellulosic material is considered as suitable feedstock, the almost \ninevitable pretreatment of this recalcitrant material may interfere with the \nsubsequent fermentation steps. In this study, the fungus Ustilago maydis was \nused to produce itaconic acid as platform chemical for the synthesis of \npotential biofuels such as 3-methyltetrahydrofuran. No studies, however, have \ninvestigated how pretreatment of ligno-cellulosic biomass precisely influences \nthe subsequent fermentation by U. maydis. Thus, this current study aims to first \ncharacterize U. maydis in shake flasks and then to evaluate the influence of \nthree exemplary pretreatment methods on the cultivation and itaconic acid \nproduction of this fungus. Cellulose enzymatically hydrolysed in seawater and \nsalt-assisted organic-acid catalysed cellulose were investigated as substrates. \nLastly, hydrolysed hemicellulose from fractionated beech wood was applied as \nsubstrate.\nRESULTS: U. maydis was characterized on shake flask level regarding its itaconic \nacid production on glucose. Nitrogen limitation was shown to be a crucial \ncondition for the production of itaconic acid. For itaconic acid concentrations \nabove 25 g\/L, a significant product inhibition was observed. Performing \nexperiments that simulated influences of possible pretreatment methods, U. \nmaydis was only slightly affected by high osmolarities up to 3.5 osmol\/L as well \nas of 0.1 M oxalic acid. The production of itaconic acid was achieved on \npretreated cellulose in seawater and on the hydrolysed hemicellulosic fraction \nof pretreated beech wood.\nCONCLUSION: The fungus U. maydis is a promising producer of itaconic acid, since \nit grows as single cells (yeast-like) in submerged cultivations and it is \nextremely robust in high osmotic media and real seawater. Moreover, U. maydis \ncan grow on the hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. Thereby, this \nfungus combines important advantages of yeasts and filamentous fungi. \nNevertheless, the biomass pretreatment does indeed affect the subsequent \nitaconic acid production. Although U. maydis is insusceptible to most possible \nimpurities from pretreatment, high amounts of salts or residues of organic acids \ncan slow microbial growth and decrease the production.

DHX36 specifically disrupts G4s in an ATP-dependent manner, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s in gene expression and replication. It recognizes and unwinds parallel G4s by utilizing two main subdomains, DSM and OB, which exhibit high affinity for G4s. The DSM subdomain primarily interacts with the guanine tetrad through extensive van der Waals contacts, while the OB subdomain forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone phosphate groups of the guanine tract. The DHX36-specific motif (DSM) promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding rate without affecting the dissociation rate.

Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high \naffinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular \ndynamics simulations. By computing binding free energies, we found that the two \nmain G4-interacting subdomains of DHX36, DSM and OB, separately exhibit high G4 \naffinity but they act cooperatively to recognize two distinctive features of \nparallel G4s: the exposed planar face of a guanine tetrad and the unique \nbackbone conformation of a continuous guanine tract, respectively.

In contrast to DSM, OB binds to G4 \nmostly through polar interactions by flexibly adapting to the 5'-terminal \nguanine tract to form a number of strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone \nphosphate groups.

These approaches were prone to identifying \nindirect or non-physiological interactions. In order to increase the specificity \nand positional resolution, a strategy referred to as CLIP (UV cross-linking and \nimmunoprecipitation) was introduced. CLIP combines UV cross-linking of proteins \nand RNA molecules with rigorous purification schemes including denaturing \npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In combination with high-throughput \nsequencing technologies, CLIP has proven as a powerful tool to study protein-RNA \ninteractions on a genome-wide scale (referred to as HITS-CLIP or CLIP-seq). \nRecently, PAR-CLIP was introduced that uses photoreactive ribonucleoside analogs \nfor cross-linking. Despite the high specificity of the obtained data, CLIP \nexperiments often generate cDNA libraries of limited sequence complexity. This \nis partly due to the restricted amount of co-purified RNA and the two \ninefficient RNA ligation reactions required for library preparation. In \naddition, primer extension assays indicated that many cDNAs truncate prematurely \nat the crosslinked nucleotide. Such truncated cDNAs are lost during the standard \nCLIP library preparation protocol. We recently developed iCLIP \n(individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP), which captures the truncated cDNAs by \nreplacing one of the inefficient intermolecular RNA ligation steps with a more \nefficient intramolecular cDNA circularization (Figure 1). Importantly, \nsequencing the truncated cDNAs provides insights into the position of the \ncross-link site at nucleotide resolution. We successfully applied iCLIP to study \nhnRNP C particle organization on a genome-wide scale and assess its role in \nsplicing regulation.","Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is increasingly used to map \ntranscriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. We developed a method \nfor CLIP data analysis, and applied it to compare CLIP with photoactivatable \nribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) and to uncover how differences in \ncross-linking and ribonuclease digestion affect the identified sites. We found \nonly small differences in accuracies of these methods in identifying binding \nsites of HuR, which binds low-complexity sequences, and Argonaute 2, which has a \ncomplex binding specificity. We found that cross-link-induced mutations led to \nsingle-nucleotide resolution for both PAR-CLIP and CLIP. Our results confirm the \nexpectation from original CLIP publications that RNA-binding proteins do not \nprotect their binding sites sufficiently under the denaturing conditions used \nduring the CLIP procedure, and we show that extensive digestion with \nsequence-specific RNases strongly biases the recovered binding sites. This bias \ncan be substantially reduced by milder nuclease digestion conditions."]}

H3K79Me2-containing chromatin exhibited the highest genome-wide \nenrichment for replication initiation events observed for any chromatin \nmodification examined thus far (23.39% of H3K79Me2 peaks were detected in \nregions adjacent to replication initiation events). The association of H3K79Me2 \nwith replication initiation sites was independent and not synergistic with other \nchromatin modifications. H3K79 dimethylation exhibited wider distribution on \nchromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2 \nwere enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a \nregion containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating \nDNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator \nthat could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme \nresponsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication \nalthough most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the \nabsence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect \nregulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. \nThese data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates \nwith some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to \nprevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability.","The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to \nchromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. \nMonomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated \nhistone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results \nin defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has \nbeen partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. \nHowever, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and \nit remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication \nprogram on a genomic scale.

Furthermore, guide RNAs are essential components of novel gene \nediting modalities, and mRNA therapeutics are under development for protein \nreplacement therapy or vaccination, including those against unprecedented severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, functional RNAs or \nRNA motifs are highly structured to form binding pockets or clefts that are \naccessible by small molecules. Many natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic \nantibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, oxazolidinones, \nand phenicols) can directly bind to ribosomal RNAs to achieve the inhibition of \nbacterial infections. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing \nRNA-targeted small-molecule drugs amenable to oral administration, and some \n(e.g., risdiplam and branaplam) have entered clinical trials. Here, we review \nthe pharmacology of novel RNA drugs and RNA-targeted small-molecule medications, \nwith a focus on recent progresses and strategies. Challenges in the development \nof novel druggable RNA entities and identification of viable RNA targets and \nselective small-molecule binders are discussed. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: With the \nunderstanding of RNA functions and critical roles in diseases, as well as the \ndevelopment of RNA-related technologies, there is growing interest in developing \nnovel RNA-based therapeutics. This comprehensive review presents pharmacology of \nboth RNA drugs and RNA-targeted small-molecule medications, focusing on novel \nmechanisms of action, the most recent progress, and existing challenges."]}

In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the \ntreatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the \nmultinational, phase\u00a0III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are \nongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial \nlipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of \nvolanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult \npatients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in \nwhom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.","BACKGROUND: Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is \ncaused by loss of lipoprotein lipase activity and characterized by \nchylomicronemia and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. There are no effective \ntherapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, \nantisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic APOC3 mRNA with volanesorsen led to \ndecreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels.\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to \nevaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with \nfamilial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 \nratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the \npercentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma \napolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, \ncorresponding to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo \nhad an increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 \nmg per deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving \nvolanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a \nmean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence \ninterval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), \nwhereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride \nlevels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per \nliter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter]) \n(P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as \ncompared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of \nless than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 \npatients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of \nthe patients who received placebo had such reactions.

Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n(RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 \nof the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in \nthe majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE \ngradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions \nof culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of \nseven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were \nproduced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were \nproduced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times \nthat of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were \nequivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR \nand NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was \nadapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed \nA549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. \nUsing either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and \nGRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for \nBLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and\/or receptor \nsubtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially \nrecognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in \nthe BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The \n2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that \nshowed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against \nthe 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), \ncompared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and \nNMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and \nGRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and \nexpression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and \nexpression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be \ntargeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and \nGRP.","Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the \nbombesin (BB)-family of peptides.

{"input":"Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?","actual_output":"The mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure are between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C). This is because the directional mutation pressure affects the variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational biases between these bases.","retrieval_context":["A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962 \nexplained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different \nbacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The \ntheory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is \nnot random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine \ncontent of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral \nparts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA \nsequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of \nneutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined \nparameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants \nwere discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all \norganisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers \nplausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine \ncontent among different parts of the vertebrate genome.","When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of \nDNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six \n(type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is \nexpected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C \ncontent of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the \nparity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result \nmostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two \nstrands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for \nevaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional \nmutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational \nbiases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias \nmutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional \nselection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis \nshows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of \nfour-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C \ncontent of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly \ncounteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C \ncontent.","Directional mutation pressure associated with replication processes is the main \ncause of the asymmetry between the leading and lagging DNA strands in bacterial \ngenomes. On the other hand, the asymmetry between sense and antisense strands of \nprotein coding sequences is a result of both mutation and selection pressures. \nThus, there are two different ways of superposition of the sense strand, on the \nleading or lagging strand. Besides many other implications of these two possible \nsituations, one seems to be very important - because of the asymmetric \nreplication-associated mutation pressure, the mutation rate of genes depends on \ntheir location. Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under \nexperimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and \nthe elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the \nleading\/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome. We have found \nthat the best survival strategy for the majority of genes is to sometimes switch \nbetween DNA strands. Paradoxically, this strategy results in higher substitution \nrates but remains in agreement with observations in bacterial genomes that such \ninversions are very frequent and divergence rate between homologs lying on \ndifferent DNA strands is very high."]}

Predicting performance prior to BCI \nuse would facilitate selection of the most feasible system for an individual, \nthus constitute a practical benefit for the user, and increase our knowledge \nabout the correlates of BCI control. In a recent study, we predicted SMR-BCI \nperformance from psychological variables that were assessed prior to the BCI \nsessions and BCI control was supported with machine-learning techniques. We \ndescribed two significant psychological predictors, namely the visuo-motor \ncoordination ability and the ability to concentrate on the task. The purpose of \nthe current study was to replicate these results thereby validating these \npredictors within a neurofeedback based SMR-BCI that involved no machine \nlearning.Thirty-three healthy BCI novices participated in a calibration session \nand three further neurofeedback training sessions.

Affected \npatients fall into two complementation groups, pccA and pccBC (subgroups B, C, \nand BC), resulting from deficiency of the nonidentical alpha and beta subunits \nof PCC, respectively. We have detected an unusual insertion\/deletion in the DNA \nof patients from the pccBC and pccC subgroups that replaces 14 nucleotides in \nthe coding sequence of the beta subunit with 12 nucleotides unrelated to this \nregion of the gene. This results in elimination of an Msp I restriction site, a \n2-base-pair (bp) deletion, a frameshift, and a stop codon in the new frame \napproximately 100 amino acid residues proximal to the normal carboxyl terminus. \nAmong 14 unrelated Caucasian patients in the pccBC complementation group, this \nunique mutation was found in 8 of 28 mutant alleles examined. Mutant \nallele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic DNAs revealed \nthat the inserted 12 nucleotides do not originate in an approximately 1000-bp \nregion around the mutation. In the course of our investigation, we identified \nanother mutation in the same exon: a 3-bp in-frame deletion that eliminates one \nof two isoleucine codons immediately preceding the Msp I site. Two unrelated \npatients were compound heterozygotes for this single-codon deletion and for the \ninsertion\/deletion described above. We conclude that either there is a \npropensity for the PCC beta-subunit gene to undergo mutations of this sort at \nthis position or, more likely, the mutations in all of the involved Caucasian \npatients have a common origin in preceding generations.","Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of \npropionyl-CoA carboxylase, a heteropolymeric mitochondrial enzyme involved in \nthe catabolism of branched chain amino acids, odd-numbered chain length fatty \nacids, cholesterol, and other metabolites.

The identification of the \nresponsible gene, previous to mutation analysis, can be performed by \ncomplementation assay or, in some instances, can be deduced from peculiarities \nrelevant to either gene, including obtaining normal enzyme activity in the \nparents of many patients with PCCB mutations, observing combined absence of \nalpha and beta subunits by Western blot of many PCCA patients, as well as \nconventional mRNA-minus result of Northern blots for either gene or beta subunit \ndeficiency in PCCB patients. Mutations in both the PCCA and PCCB genes have been \nidentified by sequencing either RT-PCR products or amplified exonic fragments, \nthe latter specifically for the PCCB gene for which the genomic structure is \navailable. To date, 24 mutations in the PCCA gene and 29 in the PCCB gene have \nbeen reported, most of them single base substitutions causing amino acid \nreplacements and a variety of splicing defects. A greater heterogeneity is \nobserved in the PCCA gene-no mutation is predominant in the populations \nstudied-while for the PCCB gene, a limited number of mutations is responsible \nfor the majority of the alleles characterized in both Caucasian and Oriental \npopulations. These two populations show a different spectrum of mutations, only \nsharing some involving CpG dinucleotides, probably as recurrent mutational \nevents.

Here, \nwe report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro \nand that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent \nendocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2 \nsignaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to \nthe recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin \n(IL)-1\u03b2, pro-IL-18, and gasdermin-D by activated caspase-1 resulted in the \ncellular release of the mature cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and induction of \npyroptosis. Consistent with this result, a dose-dependent cytokine response was \ndetected in the extracellular fluids of mice challenged intraperitoneally with \nS. aureus EVs. Pore-forming toxins associated with S. aureus EVs were critical \nfor NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation of human macrophages, but not for TLR2 \nsignaling.

Here, we \npresent a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human \nbody fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of \nultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient \ncentrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in \nstool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in \nblood.

{"input":"Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?","actual_output":"The kinase that is regulating stress granule biogenesis is AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase).","retrieval_context":["Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy \nagainst various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with \ndeleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not \nfully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is \ncritical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK \ncatalytic \u03b1-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique \nfunctions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links \nbetween AMPK-\u03b1 isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG \nassociation of AMPK-\u03b12, but not AMPK-\u03b11. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK \nactivity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered \nwith SG formation. Second, AMPK-\u03b1 knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative \nSG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, \noverexpression of mutant \u03b1-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG \nparameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-\u03b12 \nbinding partner. This interaction is stimulated by stress and notably occurs in \nSGs.

We report an unanticipated link \nbetween stress granules and the serine\/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast \ncells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding \nprotein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The \nRSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the \nprion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in \nresponse to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits \nits nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal \ndomain. Nuclear accumulation is dependent on TIA-1. Surprisingly, nuclear \nlocalization of RSK2 is sufficient to enhance proliferation through induction of \ncyclin D1, in the absence of other active signaling pathways. Hence, RSK2 is a \npivotal factor linking the stress response to survival and proliferation.","Upon exposure to various environmental stresses such as arsenite, hypoxia, and \nheat shock, cells inhibit their translation and apoptosis and then repair \nstress-induced alterations, such as DNA damage and the accumulation of misfolded \nproteins. These types of stresses induce the formation of cytoplasmic RNA \ngranules called stress granules (SGs). SGs are storage sites for the many mRNAs \nreleased from disassembled polysomes under these stress conditions and are \nessential for the selective translation of stress-inducible genes. \nRas-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a \ncomponent of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer. In \nthis study, we examined the role of G3BP2, a close relative of G3BP1, in SG \nformation. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells \npartially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the \nknockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number. G3BP2 formed a \nhomo-multimer and a hetero-multimer with G3BP1. Moreover, like G3BP1, the \noverexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli.

Although genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause \nMajeed syndrome, little is known about the biochemical regulation of its PAP \nactivity. Here, in an attempt to gain a better general understanding of the \nbiochemical nature of lipin 2, we have performed kinetic and phosphorylation \nanalyses. We provide evidence that lipin 2, like lipin 1, binds PA via the \nelectrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism but has a lower rate of catalysis. \nLike lipin 1, lipin 2 is highly phosphorylated, and we identified 15 \nphosphosites. However, unlike lipin 1, the phosphorylation of lipin 2 is not \ninduced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian \ntarget of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively \nregulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2 \nfunctions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the \nhigh degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of \nlipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin \nfamily functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an \nexample of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector \nproteins.","PolyA polymerase (PAP) adds a polyA tail onto the 3'-end of RNAs without a \nnucleic acid template, using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) as a substrate.

The essential contribution of \nSCCRO to neddylation is to promote nuclear translocation of the cullin-ROC1 \ncomplex. The presence of a myristoyl sequence in SCCRO3, one of four SCCRO \nparalogues present in humans that localizes to the membrane, raises questions \nabout its function in neddylation. We found that although SCCRO3 binds to CAND1, \ncullins, and ROC1, it does not efficiently bind to Ubc12, promote cullin \nneddylation, or conform to the reaction processivity paradigms, suggesting that \nSCCRO3 does not have E3 activity.

This article \nsummarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its \nfirst global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in \npaediatric patients \u22653\u00a0years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU \nfor CLN2 in all ages.","BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an \nenzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid \nlipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes \nprogressive dementia in children.\nMETHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of \nintraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with \nCLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was \ninitiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received \nthe 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a \n2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 \nClinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function \nand 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was \ncompared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We \nalso compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two \ngroups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more \nthan 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks).\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy \npopulation. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score \nwas not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. \nThe mean (\u00b1SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per \n48-week period was 0.27\u00b10.35 points in treated patients and 2.12\u00b10.98 points in \n42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events \nincluded convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure \nof the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the \nintraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required \nantibiotic treatment and device replacement.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 \ndisease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in \nhistorical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the \nintraventricular device and device-related infections.

{"input":"Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?","actual_output":"The paralog of yeast UPC2 is the YLR228c gene product. This is inferred from the text stating that the YLR228c protein is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins.","retrieval_context":["Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important \nregulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans. \nTo better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location \nprofiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. A triple \nhemagglutinin epitope, introduced at the C terminus of Upc2p, conferred a \ngain-of-function effect on the fusion protein. Location profiling identified 202 \nbound promoters (P < 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose \npromoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol \nbiosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal \nsubunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters \n(CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2, \nSUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, \nSAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to \nthe DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p \nbinding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding \ncorrelates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11, \nMDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1 \ntranscripts in wild-type and upc2Delta\/upc2Delta strains grown under \nUpc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p \nregulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a \nrepressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken \ntogether, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol \nmetabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by \nregulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to \nergosterol biosynthesis genes.","The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is \ncrucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens \nsuch as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription \nfactors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression \nof either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking \nboth ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively \ncontrol the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These \ngenes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is \nupregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22\/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, \nergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also \nincreases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors \nSut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control \nof the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12 \nbecomes activated and reduces SUT1\/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in \nincreased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of \nFHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in \ncombination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the \ntransition to filamentous growth.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally will not take up sterols from the environment \nunder aerobic conditions. A specific mutant, upc2-1, of the predicted \ntranscriptional activator UPC2 (YDR213w) has been recognized as a strain that \nallows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional \nactivator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at \nthe carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two \nproteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the \nYLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2. \nFirst, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various \nUPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in \nnonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping \nfunction. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was \nduplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using \nsite-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an \nincrease in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The \ncombination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic \nsterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy \nvector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

The workflow is often characterized as a \"black box\" \nbecause an experimentalist does not know if it has been performed successfully \nuntil the last of several steps. Moreover, the quality of western blot data is \nsometimes challenged due to a lack of effective quality control tools in place \nthroughout the western blotting process. Here we describe the V3 western \nworkflow, which applies stain-free technology to address the major concerns \nassociated with the traditional western blot protocol. This workflow allows \nresearchers: 1) to run a gel in about 20-30 min; 2) to visualize sample \nseparation quality within 5 min after the gel run; 3) to transfer proteins in \n3-10 min; 4) to verify transfer efficiency quantitatively; and most importantly \n5) to validate changes in the level of the protein of interest using total \nprotein loading control. This novel approach eliminates the need of stripping \nand reprobing the blot for housekeeping proteins such as \u03b2-actin, \u03b2-tubulin, \nGAPDH, etc. The V3 stain-free workflow makes the western blot process faster, \ntransparent, more quantitative\u00a0and reliable.","In Western blotting, a suitable loading control is indispensable for correcting \nerrors in the total amount of loaded protein. Immunodetection of housekeeping \nproteins and total protein staining have traditionally been used as loading \ncontrol methods. Direct Blue 71 (DB71) staining-a novel, sensitive, dye-binding \nstaining method compatible with immunodetection-may offer advantages over these \ntraditional loading control methods. Three common neuroscientific samples (human \nplasma, human oligodendrocytes, and rat brain) were employed to assess DB71 \nstaining as a loading control method for Western blotting. DB71, CBB, one \ntraditional housekeeping protein, and one protein of interest were comparatively \nassessed for reliability and repeatability and linear dynamic range over 2.5-40 \n\u03bcg of protein loaded. DB71's effect on the reliability and repeatability and \nlinear dynamic range of immunoreaction were also assessed. Across all three \nsample types, DB71 was either equivalent or superior to CBB and housekeeping \nprotein-based methods in terms of reliability and repeatability and linear \ndynamic range. Across all three sample types, DB71 staining did not impair the \nreliability and repeatability or linear dynamic range of immunoreaction. Our \nresults demonstrate that the DB71 staining can be used as a destaining-free \nalternative loading control method for Western blotting."]}

The models developed by \ndifferent researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different \nsets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a \nsingle model with good predictive values. One of the main reasons for this \nchallenge is related to relatively large size of the active sites and \nflexibility of the CYP isoenzymes, which results in multiple binding sites. We \npropose development of multiple- diverse pharmacophore models for each binding \nmode (as opposed to a single predictive model for each CYP isoenzyme). After \nscoring and prioritization of the models, we propose the use of a battery of \npharmacophore models for each CYP isoenzyme binding mode to computationally \nobtain a P450 interaction profile for drug candidates early in the drug \ndevelopment cycle, when decisions on their fate can be made before incurring the \ncosts of synthesis and testing.","Cytochrome P450 (P450) 17A enzymes play a critical role in the oxidation of the \nsteroids progesterone (Prog) and pregnenolone (Preg) to glucocorticoids and \nandrogens. In mammals, a single enzyme, P450 17A1, catalyzes both \n17\u03b1-hydroxylation and a subsequent 17\u03b1,20-lyase reaction with both Prog and \nPreg. Teleost fish contain two 17A P450s; zebrafish P450 17A1 catalyzes both \n17\u03b1-hydroxylation and lyase reactions with Prog and Preg, and P450 17A2 is more \nefficient in pregnenolone 17\u03b1-hydroxylation but does not catalyze the lyase \nreaction, even in the presence of cytochrome b5. P450 17A2 binds all substrates \nand products, although more loosely than P450 17A1. Pulse-chase and kinetic \nspectral experiments and modeling established that the two-step P450 17A1 Prog \noxidation is more distributive than the Preg reaction, i.e. 17\u03b1-OH product \ndissociates more prior to the lyase step. The drug orteronel selectively blocked \nthe lyase reaction of P450 17A1 but only in the case of Prog. X-ray crystal \nstructures of zebrafish P450 17A1 and 17A2 were obtained with the ligand \nabiraterone and with Prog for P450 17A2.

To decrease \nthe probability of late clinical failure or market withdrawal, there has been an \nincreased prioritization on understanding key metabolic processes that might \ncause drug interactions or toxicities. Significant advances have been made in \nthe detection of reactive metabolites and in understanding the structure \nactivity relationship. It is now widely accepted that compounds with certain \nfunctional groups such as anilines, quinones, hydrazines, thiophenes, furans, \nacylpropionic acids, and alkynes have a much greater associated risk towards \nformation of reactive metabolites than compounds that do not contain such \n\"structural alerts\".

{"input":"What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?","actual_output":"The major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning, according to the provided context, is the DNA sequence itself. However, it's important to note that while the DNA sequence plays a significant role, other factors such as histone proteins and their interactions with the DNA, as well as the chromatin environment, also contribute to nucleosome positioning. The specific patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA, such as the presence of AT-rich and GC-rich motifs, the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps, and the deformability of certain motifs at specific sites, are key factors influencing nucleosome positioning.","retrieval_context":["Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA \nsequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although \nthe search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on \nfor about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based \non our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions \nto predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between \nour approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal \nDNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of \npyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., \nYYRR versus RYRY); (iii) we postulate that alternating AT-rich and GC-rich \nmotifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and DNA \nin the minor groove. Using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions \nmapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, \nthe pGUB plasmid, chicken beta-globin and three 5S rDNA genes). We predicted 15 \nof the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. \nThe predicted position of the '601' nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the \ncomputed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by \nno more than 1 bp - an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. Our \nanalysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be \ndivided into two groups based on the positioning 'rules' they follow. The \nsequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable YR\/YYRR motifs at the \nminor-groove bending sites SHL+\/- 3.5 and +\/- 5.5, which is similar to the \nalpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the \npositioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between \nhistones H2A\/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group \n(that includes the '601' clone) the same YR\/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at \nthe sites SHL +\/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3\/H4 tetramer and the \ncentral part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the \npositioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these \nnucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the \nstereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either \nan X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of \nnucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring \npredominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA). The results presented \nhere may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking \ntogether structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the \nunderlying DNA sequence patterns guiding their positions.","Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the \nnucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common \nexperimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of \nmicrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase \nin combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the \nresulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and \nespecially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a \nconsequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major \ndeterminant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show \nthat data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched \ncontrol experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.","Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, \nquantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales. We identify the cis and \ntrans determinants of nucleosome positioning using a functional evolutionary \napproach involving S.\u00a0cerevisiae strains containing large genomic regions from \nother yeast species. In a foreign species, nucleosome depletion at promoters is \nmaintained over poly(dA:dT) tracts, whereas internucleosome spacing and all \nother aspects of nucleosome positioning tested are not. Interestingly, the \nlocations of the\u00a0+1 nucleosome and RNA start sites shift in concert. Strikingly, \nin a foreign species, nucleosome-depleted regions occur fortuitously in coding \nregions, and they often act as promoters that are associated with a positioned \nnucleosome array linked to the length of the transcription unit. We suggest a \nthree-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, \nand the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in \ngenerating the nucleosome positioning pattern in\u00a0vivo."]}

Based on \nphylogenetic analysis, the rice DUF1618 family was divided into two major \ngroups, each group consisting of two clades. Most DUF1618 genes with close \nphylogenetic relationships are located in gene clusters on the chromosomes, \nindicating that gene duplications increased the number of DUF1618 genes. A \nsearch for DUF1618 genes in genomic and\/or expressed sequence tag databases for \n35 other plant species showed that DUF1618 genes are only present in several \nmonocot plants, suggesting that DUF1618 is a new gene family that originated \nafter the dicot-monocot divergence. Based on public microarray databases, most \nrice DUF1618 genes are expressed at relatively low levels. Further experimental \nanalysis showed that the transcriptional levels of some DUF1618 genes varied in \ndifferent cultivars, and some responded to stress and hormone conditions, \nsuggesting their important roles for development and fitness in rice (Oryza \nsativa L.)."]}

A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a \nlarge sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n \u00a0bytes of RAM.

It is a minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in y. Minimal \nabsent words have been computed in genomes of organisms from all domains of \nlife; their computation also provides a fast alternative for measuring \napproximation in sequence comparison. There exists an [Formula: see text]-time \nand [Formula: see text]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words \non a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata \n(Crochemore et al., 1998). No implementation of this algorithm is publicly \navailable.

One such measure is the minimal absent \nwords. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm \nfor the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.","BACKGROUND: The problem of finding the shortest absent words in DNA data has \nbeen recently addressed, and algorithms for its solution have been described. It \nhas been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the \nexisting algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the \nshortest ones.\nRESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the \ndata, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent \nwords, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words \nintroduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An \nimplementation of this algorithm is publicly available at \nftp:\/\/www.ieeta.pt\/~ap\/maws.\nCONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much \nlarger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful \nfor applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, \nthe number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most \nlinearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow \nexponentially.

{"input":"Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?","actual_output":"The TLR7 locus is contained in the X chromosome in the human genome.","retrieval_context":["Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity, \nbut TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also \nelevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more \nsupernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement \ncontributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and \nwe examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome \ninactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. \nSingle-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial \nfractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells \nnot only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X \nchromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 \ntranscriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher \nTLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic \nB cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of \nCD27+ plasma cells.

TLR7 escape from X inactivation \nendows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This \nfinding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to \nbiallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune \ndisorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.","Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the \nresistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the \nsusceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). \nIn SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. \nMurine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous \nlupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes \nSLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted \nTLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic \ncells (pDC), monocytes\/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes \nsingle-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the \nproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each \ncell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage \nwith XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome \ninactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been \nhypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female \nimmune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. \nWe review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent \nevidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, \nmonocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B \ncells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven \nfunctional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the \nenhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent \nautoimmune syndromes.","INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome \nXp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production.

Due to the complexity and flexible nature of \nRobo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent \nstructural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis \nfor a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures \nreveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell \nsurface that can be further stabilised by cis and\/or trans oligmerisation \narrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change \nfor Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis. \nFurthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as \nlarge and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional \nand growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies \nprovide a mechanism to fine tune attractive and repulsive signals in a \ncombinatorial manner required during neuronal development.

A recent study identified neural epidermal \ngrowth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this \nstudy, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1 \nand the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic \nbinding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1\/2 binds to the first fibronectin \ntype III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis \nrevealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for \nNELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the \nfourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can \ninfluence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1\/2. \nAcidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These \nresults suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1\/2, particularly \nunder circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion. If this is not \nthe case, conformational changes of the ectodomain of Robo2 may unmask the \nbinding site for NELL1\/2.","The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate \nmidline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous \nsystem (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo \nreceptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling \ncauses ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of \nanimals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have \ninvestigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five \nImmunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the \nthree evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have \nindividually deleted each of Drosophila Robo1's three Fn repeats, and then \ntested these Robo1 variants in vitro to determine their ability to bind Slit in \ncultured Drosophila cells and in vivo to investigate the requirement for each \ndomain in regulating Robo1's embryonic expression pattern, axonal localization, \nmidline repulsive function, and sensitivity to Commissureless (Comm) \ndownregulation. We demonstrate that the Fn repeats are not required for Robo1 to \nbind Slit or for proper expression of Robo1 in Drosophila embryonic neurons. \nWhen expressed in a robo1 mutant background, these variants are able to restore \nmidline repulsion to an extent equivalent to full-length Robo1. We identify a \nnovel requirement for Fn3 in the exclusion of Robo1 from commissures and \ndownregulation of Robo1 by Comm.

Saracatinib potently inhibits Fyn \nactivation. We have noted a relationship between Fyn expression and directional \nmotility, a cellular process related to metastasis. As such we hypothesized that \ntreatment with saracatinib would increase the time required to develop new \nmetastatic lesions.\nMETHODS: Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had \nprogressed after docetaxel were eligible for enrollment. This study was executed \nas a randomized discontinuation trial. During a lead-in phase of two 28-Day \ncycles, all patients received saracatinib. Afterward, patients with \nradiographically stable disease were randomized to either saracatinib or \nplacebo. Patients continued treatment until evidence of new metastasis.\nRESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable \ndisease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early \ntermination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after \nthe lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due \nto clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in \nmore than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade \n3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia, \nand weakness.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as \nmetastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable \nin an earlier time in the disease history."]}

Additionally, in the Djungarian hamster Phodopus sungorus, 3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) was found to cause a rapid decrease in metabolic rate (VO2), body temperature (T(b)), and respiratory quotient (RQ), indicating a shift from carbohydrate to lipid utilization, and it also caused ketonuria and a significant loss of body fat.

In addition to \nphosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine \nacetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of \nS6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly \nconserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516 \nantibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently \ninduced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and \nphosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events \nappear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of \nS6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1 \nacetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.

Here we show for the \nfirst time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by \nlysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 \nand p300\/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated \nby p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing \np300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie \nwithin the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2. \nAcetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I\/II histone \ndeacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1 \nacetylation by nicotinamide suggests the additional involvement of sirtuin \ndeacetylases in S6K deacetylation. Both expression of p300 and HDAC inhibition \ncause increases in S6K protein levels, and we have shown that S6K2 is stabilized \nin cells treated with HDAC inhibitors.

To date, several of these postulates have \nnot been satisfied, and the evidence available for prostate cancer screening is \ncurrently insufficient to warrant its introduction as a public health policy. \nThe natural history of screen-detected prostate cancer remains poorly \nunderstood, and recent evidence suggests that a screening programme may detect a \nlarge number of men with indolent disease who may be subsequently overtreated. \nSeveral randomised clinical trials are currently in progress and it is hoped \nthat they will provide robust evidence to inform future practice.\nCONCLUSIONS: National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside \nrandomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to \nlack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and\/or \nquality of life in men with screen-detected disease. Forthcoming results of \nclinical trials and the application of appropriate risk stratification to \nprevent overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer are likely to change practice \nin coming years."]}

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional \n\"antagonist\" and \"agonist\" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is \nmediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on \nlymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the \nlymph node.

Here, we focussed on expanding the \npotential of lacticin 3147, one of the most studied lantibiotics and one which \npossesses potent activity against a wide range of Gram positive species \nincluding many nosocomial pathogens. More specifically, our aim was to \ninvestigate if lacticin 3147 activity could be enhanced when combined with a \nrange of different clinical antibiotics.\nRESULTS: Initial screening revealed that polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) \nexhibited synergistic activity with lacticin 3147. Checkerboard assays were \nperformed against a number of strains, including both Gram positive and Gram \nnegative species. The resultant fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index \nvalues established that, while partial synergy was detected against Gram \npositive targets, synergy was obvious against Gram negative species, including \nCronobacter and E. coli.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combining lacticin 3147 with low levels of a polymyxin could \nprovide a means of broadening target specificity of the lantibiotic, while also \nreducing polymyxin use due to the lower concentrations required as a result of \nsynergy.","Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic \nalkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be \ninduced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only \nanecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated \nwith colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge, \ncolistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in \nthe literature. We here report a-28-week, 740\u00a0g female preterm infant who \ndeveloped BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii \ninfection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the \npossible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin \npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm \ninfants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.","Novel approaches for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative \nbacterial infections are urgently required. One approach is to potentiate the \nefficacy of existing antibiotics whose spectrum of activity is limited by the \npermeability barrier presented by the Gram-negative outer membrane. Cationic \npeptides derived from polymyxin B have been used to permeabilize the outer \nmembrane, granting antibiotics that would otherwise be excluded access to their \ntargets. We assessed the in vitro efficacies of combinations of SPR741 with \nconventional antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and \nAcinetobacter baumannii Of 35 antibiotics tested, the MICs of 8 of them were \nreduced 32- to 8,000-fold against E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the presence of \nSPR741. The eight antibiotics, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, \nfusidic acid, mupirocin, retapamulin, rifampin, and telithromycin, had diverse \ntargets and mechanisms of action. Against A. baumannii, similar potentiation was \nachieved with clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, retapamulin, and \nrifampin. Susceptibility testing of the most effective antibiotic-SPR741 \ncombinations was extended to 25 additional multidrug-resistant or clinical \nisolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae and 17 additional A. baumannii isolates in \norder to rank the potentiated antibiotics. SPR741 was also able to potentiate \nantibiotics that are substrates of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in E. coli, \neffectively circumventing the contribution of this pump to intrinsic antibiotic \nresistance. These studies support the further development of SPR741 in \ncombination with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative \nbacterial infections."]}
