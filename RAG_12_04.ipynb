        "evil_text=\"Nucleosomes form the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, and previous attempts to understand the principles governing their genome-wide distribution have spurred much interest and debate in biology. In particular, the precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been controversial. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of hitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5bp, and poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome landscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to other previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, poly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the experimental method used. We further show that the 10.5bp nucleotide facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying our method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, the regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites can be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone. Finally, in vivo nucleosome occupancy derived from MNase-seq experiments around transcription termination sites can be mostly explained by the genomic sequence. Implications of these results and potential extensions of the proposed computational framework are discussed.\""

Gene-specific TSG \\nmethylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the \\ncerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in \\nmedulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus \\n0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a \\nsubset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent \\nbackground of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore \\nindicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are \\ntumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes \\nin medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic \\ntranscriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following \\ntreatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The \\nremaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF), \\np16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3, \\nTP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum \\n(EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in \\nmedulloblastoma.

We conclude that epigenetic \\nTSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify \\nRASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. \\nFurthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the \\nrequirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the \\ntumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.\", 'Recent sequencing efforts have described the mutational landscape of the \\npediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma.

Notably, we also report mutations \\naffecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 \\nmutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or \\nmolecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 \\nMBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical \\nstaining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A \\nactivity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % \\n(53/220) of MBs across all subgroups.

Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and \\ntranscriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2, \\nKDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes.

Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a \\nsingle-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate \\nthat active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a \\nnucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start \\nsite (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in \\nRUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin \\nconfigurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is \\nmethylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically \\nmethylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures \\ncomprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG \\nisland promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that \\naberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to \\ntumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer \\nepigenetics.\", 'The promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates \\ntranscription initiation of the gene.

Individualized patient management requires strict performance \\ncriteria for clinical laboratory tests. We therefore investigated the analytical \\nperformance of the assay.\\nMETHODS: Assays used a pooled RNA sample from fixed paraffin-embedded tissues to \\nevaluate the analytical performance of a 21-gene panel with respect to \\namplification efficiency, precision, linearity, and dynamic range, as well as \\nlimits of detection and quantification.

However \\nthe typical anatomic distribution of Lewy bodies in AD is distinct from PD. The \\nmost common site of occurrence is the amygdala, where Lewy bodies are observed \\nin approximately 60% of both sporadic and familial AD. Other common sites of \\noccurrence include the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortex, while neocortical \\nand brainstem areas develop Lewy bodies in a lower percentage of cases.

The observation of Lewy bodies in familial AD cases suggests that like \\nneurofibrillary tangles, the formation of Lewy bodies can be induced by the \\npathological state caused by Abeta-amyloid overproduction. The role of Lewy body \\nformation in the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons remains unclear. The \\nprotein alpha-synuclein appears to be an important structural component of Lewy \\nbodies, an observation spurred by the discovery of point mutations in the \\nalpha-synuclein gene linked to rare cases of autosomal dominant PD.

A cohort of 38 CMT2 Italian subjects was screened for mutations in the \\nMFN2, MPZ and GJB1 genes by direct sequencing and for PMP22 rearrangements using \\nthe MLPA technique. Overall, we identified 15 mutations, 8 of which were novel: \\n11 mutations (28.9\\xa0%) were in the MFN2 gene, 2 (5.3\\xa0%) in MPZ and 2 (5.3\\xa0%) in \\nPMP22. No mutations were found in GJB1.

Although there has been major \\nadvances in the understanding of the genetic basis of CMT in recent years, the \\nmost useful classification is still a neurophysiological classification that \\ndivides CMT into type 1 (demyelinating; median motor conduction velocity < 38 \\nm/s) and type 2 (axonal; median motor conduction velocity > 38 m/s). An \\nintermediate type is also increasingly being described. Inheritance can be \\nautosomal-dominant (AD), X-linked, or autosomal-recessive (AR).

Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, \\nLITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI \\nand a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also \\ncause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria).

It primarily acts as a master regulator of gene expression by sequestering or \"sponge\"ing other gene expression regulators, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs).

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae. Since coronary aneurysms have been reported, echocardiographic follow-up is needed.\n",

RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly \\neffective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features. \\nCurrently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab.

These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being \\ncanakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are \\nunselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that \\nspecificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing \\npericarditis, although it has been proposed that unspecific blockage might be \\nuseful in severe disease. Anakinra is the first anti-IL-1 agent with \\nwell-documented efficacy and safety in adult and pediatric patients with \\nidiopathic relapsing pericarditis. Other anti-IL-1 agents are currently under \\nstudy. Future research should clarify the optimal duration of therapy and \\ntapering schedule of treatment with these agents. Moreover, biomarkers would be \\nrequired to understand which patients will benefit from early administration of \\nIL-1 blockers due to refractoriness to conventional therapy and which others \\nwill suffer from recurrences during the tapering of these agents. Lastly, future \\nstudies should focus on the subjects with the autoimmune or the \\npauci-inflammatory phenotype of idiopathic refractory pericarditis.']\n",

In \\nmammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin \\nacetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies \\nof the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of \\ntubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to \\nneurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological \\nconditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review \\nsummarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important \\nfor regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity. \\nTogether with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin \\nacetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and \\nfunction.\"]\n",

We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting \\nstrategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial \\nstages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.', 'In the last decade, it has been well-established that tumor-infiltrating myeloid \\ncells fuel not only the process of carcinogenesis through cancer-related \\ninflammation mechanisms, but also tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. \\nIn particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant \\nleucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a \\nprotective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an \\nimmune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to \\nallow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional \\ntherapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit \\ncancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also \\nresponsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint \\ninhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to \\ndeplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as \\nweapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the \\nreprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral \\nmacrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells.

The \\ntheory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is \\nnot random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine \\ncontent of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral \\nparts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA \\nsequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of \\nneutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined \\nparameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants \\nwere discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all \\norganisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers \\nplausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine \\ncontent among different parts of the vertebrate genome.', 'When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of \\nDNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six \\n(type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is \\nexpected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C \\ncontent of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the \\nparity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result \\nmostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two \\nstrands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for \\nevaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional \\nmutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational \\nbiases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias \\nmutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional \\nselection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis \\nshows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of \\nfour-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C \\ncontent of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly \\ncounteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C \\ncontent.', 'Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the \\neffect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of \\nsubstitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under \\nvarious degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts \\nthat when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is \\nequilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the \\nmutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately \\nafter the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide \\nvariation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also \\nthe wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of \\nmulticellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that \\nare not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field \\nof molecular evolution, including belief in a constant rate of evolution, \\nsymmetric branching of phylogenetic trees, the generality of higher mutation \\nfrequency for neutral sets of nucleotides, the notion that mutator mutations are \\ngenerally deleterious because of their high mutation rates, and teleological \\nexplanations of DNA base composition.']\n",

BEVs in human body fluids have \\nbeen less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological \\nchallenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic \\nextracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we \\npresent a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human \\nbody fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of \\nultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient \\ncentrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in \\nstool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in \\nblood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool; \\nand low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), \\nchylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood.

This article \\nsummarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its \\nfirst global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in \\npaediatric patients ≥3\\xa0years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU \\nfor CLN2 in all ages.', 'BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an \\nenzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid \\nlipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes \\nprogressive dementia in children.\\nMETHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of \\nintraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with \\nCLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was \\ninitiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received \\nthe 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a \\n2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 \\nClinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function \\nand 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was \\ncompared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We \\nalso compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two \\ngroups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more \\nthan 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks).\\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy \\npopulation. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score \\nwas not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. \\nThe mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per \\n48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in \\n42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events \\nincluded convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure \\nof the intraventricular device.

Here, we examine the role of the related transcription \\nfactors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression \\nof either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking \\nboth ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively \\ncontrol the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes.

Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose \\npromoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol \\nbiosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal \\nsubunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters \\n(CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2, \\nSUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, \\nSAM2, SAH1, and others).

Taken \\ntogether, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol \\nmetabolism.

Nevertheless, \\nmembrane perforations represent the most common complication among these \\nprocedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the \\nrelevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications.\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed \\nby two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, \\nand Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018 \\nreporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without \\nregenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft \\nmaterial.

Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could \\neither impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and \\nanti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic \\nbone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, \\nprostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate; \\nanti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin, \\nbiphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators \\n(SERM). Examples of the new therapies include DKK1- and anti-sclerostin \\nantibodies. All classes of treatments have proven to possess positive impacts \\nsuch as an increase in bone mineral density and on osseointegration. In order to \\nprevent complications from occurring after surgery, some post-operative systemic \\ndrugs are administered; these can show an impairment in the osseointegration \\nprocess.

Safety measures included adverse events, physical \\nexamination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily \\nCeliac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue \\ntransglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion \\nratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and \\nacceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week \\ntreatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals.\\nRESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4\\xa0years, nine female). \\nAll followed a GFD for at least 6\\xa0months (mean 5\\xa0years). No safety concerns were \\nidentified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness, \\nheadache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and \\nlowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period.\\nCONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved \\nCD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD.

The enzymatic activity of nine CYP isoforms was not inhibited or \\nslightly inhibited in vitro with darolutamide, and a rank order and mechanistic \\nstatic assessment indicated that risk of clinically relevant DDIs via CYP \\ninhibition is very low. In vitro, darolutamide exhibited no relevant induction \\nof CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 activity. Inhibition of BCRP-, P-gp-, OAT3-, MATE1-, \\nMATE2-K-, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport was observed in vitro. Phase I \\ndata showed that darolutamide exposure increased 1.75-fold with co-administered \\nitraconazole and decreased by 72% with rifampicin. Co-administration of \\ndarolutamide with CYP3A4/P-gp substrates showed no effect or only minor effects. \\nRosuvastatin exposure increased 5.2-fold with darolutamide because of BCRP and \\nprobably also OATPB1/OATPB3 inhibition.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Darolutamide has a low potential for clinically relevant DDIs with \\ndrugs that are substrates for CYP or P-gp; increased exposure of BCRP and \\nprobably OATP substrates was the main interaction of note.']\n",

Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a \"younger\" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

Although \\nthe search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on \\nfor about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based \\non our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions \\nto predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between \\nour approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal \\nDNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of \\npyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., \\nYYRR versus RYRY); (iii) we postulate that alternating AT-rich and GC-rich \\nmotifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and DNA \\nin the minor groove. Using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions \\nmapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, \\nthe pGUB plasmid, chicken beta-globin and three 5S rDNA genes). We predicted 15 \\nof the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. \\nThe predicted position of the '601' nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the \\ncomputed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by \\nno more than 1 bp - an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. Our \\nanalysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be \\ndivided into two groups based on the positioning 'rules' they follow. The \\nsequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable YR/YYRR motifs at the \\nminor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the \\nalpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the \\npositioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between \\nhistones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group \\n(that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at \\nthe sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the \\ncentral part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the \\npositioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these \\nnucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the \\nstereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either \\nan X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of \\nnucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring \\npredominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA).

This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and \\nespecially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a \\nconsequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major \\ndeterminant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show \\nthat data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched \\ncontrol experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.', 'Nucleosomes form the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, and \\nprevious attempts to understand the principles governing their genome-wide \\ndistribution have spurred much interest and debate in biology.

Our \\ncomputational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and \\nnucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to \\nother previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo \\nnucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

It is a minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in y. Minimal \\nabsent words have been computed in genomes of organisms from all domains of \\nlife; their computation also provides a fast alternative for measuring \\napproximation in sequence comparison. There exists an [Formula: see text]-time \\nand [Formula: see text]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words \\non a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata \\n(Crochemore et al., 1998). No implementation of this algorithm is publicly \\navailable. There also exists an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see \\ntext]-space algorithm for the same problem based on the construction of suffix \\narrays (Pinho et al., 2009). An implementation of this algorithm was also \\nprovided by the authors and is currently the fastest available.\\nRESULTS: Our contribution in this article is twofold: first, we bridge this \\nunpleasant gap by presenting an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see \\ntext]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words based on the \\nconstruction of suffix arrays; and second, we provide the respective \\nimplementation of this algorithm. Experimental results, using real and synthetic \\ndata, show that this implementation outperforms the one by Pinho et al. The \\nopen-source code of our implementation is freely available at \\nhttp://github.com/solonas13/maw .\\nCONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being \\nreplaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences \\nin terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent \\nwords. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm \\nfor the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.', 'BACKGROUND: The problem of finding the shortest absent words in DNA data has \\nbeen recently addressed, and algorithms for its solution have been described. It \\nhas been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the \\nexisting algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the \\nshortest ones.\\nRESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the \\ndata, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent \\nwords, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words \\nintroduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \\nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \\nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \\nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An \\nimplementation of this algorithm is publicly available at \\nftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws.\\nCONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much \\nlarger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful \\nfor applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, \\nthe number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most \\nlinearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow \\nexponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed \\nadditional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing \\nstudies on the topic.']\n",

Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes \\nSLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted \\nTLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic \\ncells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells.

In our study, we \\ninvestigated the effect of saracatinib on the reversal of multidrug resistance \\n(MDR) induced by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in vitro and in vivo. \\nOur results showed that saracatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of \\nABCB1 substrate drugs in ABCB1 overexpressing HeLa/v200, MCF-7/adr and \\nHEK293/ABCB1 cells, an effect that was stronger than that of gefitinib, whereas \\nit had no effect on the cytotoxicity of the substrates in ABCC1 overexpressing \\nHL-60/adr cells and its parental sensitive cells. Additionally, saracatinib \\nsignificantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in \\nHeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells. \\nFurthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited \\nphotolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a \\nconcentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the \\nbinding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding \\ncavity of human ABCB1.

Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions, \\nwe found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in \\nthe cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary \\nfibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the \\nmTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor \\ncomplex is abundant in both compartments. Rapamycin negatively regulates the \\nformation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on \\nmTORC2 remained elusive. We describe that in primary cells short-term treatment \\nwith rapamycin triggers dephosphorylation of rictor and sin1 exclusively in the \\ncytoplasm, but does not affect mTORC2 assembly. Prolonged drug treatment leads \\nto complete dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear rictor \\nand sin1 accompanied by inhibition of mTORC2 assembly. The distinct cytoplasmic \\nand nuclear upstream and downstream effectors of mTOR are involved in many \\ncancers and human genetic diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers \\nsyndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, polycystic kidney \\ndisease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and diabetes. \\nAccordingly, analogs of rapamycin are currently tested in many different \\nclinical trials. Our data allow new insights into the molecular consequences of \\nmTOR dysregulation under pathophysiological conditions and should help to \\noptimize rapamycin treatment of human diseases.\", 'LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). \\nHerein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in \\nthe regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in \\nHepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase \\nbut also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased \\nphosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the \\nLST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since \\nLST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and \\nmTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be \\nreduced by over-expression of the Cterminally deleted Raptor mutant (Raptor-ΔCT) \\nnot binding to mTOR or LST8, while phosphorylation levels of Akt were markedly \\nenhanced with no alteration in IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity. \\nUsing Raptor-ΔCT, we investigated the competition for association with LST8 \\nbetween mTORC1 and mTORC2. Over-expression of Raptor-ΔCT abolished formation of \\nthe Raptor, S6 kinase, mTOR and LST8 complex, while the amount of LST8 in the \\nRictor-mTOR complex was increased. Therefore, it is likely that Raptor-mTOR and \\nRictor-mTOR complexes compete for association with LST8, and this mechanism may \\ncontribute to the reciprocal negative regulations of mTORC1 and mTORC2 \\nactivities, in terms of their LST8 components.:']\n",

Diabetes \\nresulted in significant alterations in SERCA and NCX activities in CECs during \\n[Ca(2+)](i) sequestration and efflux, respectively, while no difference in PMCA \\nactivity between diabetic and wild-type cells was observed. These results \\nimprove our understanding of how diabetes affects calcium regulation in CECs, \\nand may contribute to the development of new therapies for DCM treatment.', 'The use of insulin by diabetics has largely removed the threat of death from \\nketotic coma but cardiovascular dysfunction remains a major cause of death in \\npatients with diabetes. Recent research has indicated a generalized membrane \\ndefect, which may cause abnormalities of calcium metabolism in nerves, cardiac \\nand smooth muscle as well as endothelial cells and thus may lead respectively to \\nthe development of neuropathy, primary cardiomyopathy, microangiopathy and \\natherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes, \\nwhich are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with \\nothers, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the \\nsympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have \\nbeen identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump \\nfailure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane \\ndefects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in \\ndiabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the \\nmetabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides.

Mitochondria are susceptible \\nto the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and \\noxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause \\ncardiac dysfunction. Here, we examined the effect of high-glucose induced \\ncalcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac apoptosis in an in vitro setting.\\nMETHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated \\nglucose condition and the cellular consequences were studied. Intracellular \\ncalcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and \\ncaspase-9 pathway were studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and \\nWestern blot analysis.\\nRESULTS: High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium \\n([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. Concomitant \\nintra-mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive \\noxygen and nitrogen species generation. These events led to mitochondrial \\ndysfunction and apoptosis. Cardiomyocyte death exhibited several classical \\nmarkers of apoptosis, including activation of caspases, appearance of annexin V \\non the outer plasma membrane, increased population of cells with sub-G0/G1 DNA \\ncontent and nuclear condensation. Key findings include elucidation of cell \\nsignaling mechanism of high-glucose induced calcium-dependent cysteine protease \\ncalpain-1 activation, which triggers non-conventional caspases as alternate mode \\nof cell death.\\nCONCLUSION: This information increases the understanding of cardiac cell death \\nunder hyperglycemic condition and can possibly be extended for designing new \\ntherapeutic strategies for diabetic cardiomyopathy.\\nGENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The novel findings of the study reveal that high glucose \\ninduces apoptosis by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via \\nconcomitant rise in intracellular calcium.']\n",

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional \\n\"antagonist\" and \"agonist\" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is \\nmediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on \\nlymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the \\nlymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and \\nreduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed \\nthrough S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including \\nneurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These \\nfunctions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems, \\nmodulating brain immune and phagocytic activities, preserving the \\nBlood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), and the proliferation of neural precursor cells. \\nRecently, FTY720 have shown receptor-independent effects, including \\nintracellular target bindings and epigenetic modulations. Many researchers have \\nrecognized the positive effects of FTY720 and launched basic and clinical \\nexperiments to test the use of this agent against stroke. Although the mechanism \\nof FTY720 has not been fully elucidated, its efficacy against cerebral stroke is \\nbecoming clear, not only in animal models, but also in ischemic stroke patients \\nthrough clinical trials. In this article, we review the data obtained from \\nlaboratory findings and preliminary clinical trials using FTY720 for stroke \\ntreatment.', 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a leading cause of liver dysfunction, \\nis a metabolic disease that begins with steatosis.

Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in \\na diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks \\nof the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a \\nhigh-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis. \\nIn addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic \\nsphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and \\nsphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and \\ndihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase \\n(FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in \\nlipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which \\ntranscriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the \\nactive phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, \\nFTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly \\nincreased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN \\nexpression and triglyceride accumulation associated with steatosis.']\n",

Gene-specific TSG \\nmethylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the \\ncerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in \\nmedulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus \\n0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a \\nsubset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent \\nbackground of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum.

To evaluate \\nthe relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of \\nthe head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the \\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. \\nThis publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study.\\nMETHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and \\ncentral nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. \\nEligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly \\ndiagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003.

The statistical \\npower of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility \\nof an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in \\nthe international INTERPHONE analyses.', \"Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of \\nmobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for \\nmeningioma.

The aim of this study \\nwas to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years) \\nuse of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We \\nconducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged \\n18-75 years and diagnosed during 2007-2009. One population-based control matched \\non gender and age (within 5 years) was used to each case. Here, we report on \\nmalignant cases including all available controls.

Of the cases with a malignant brain tumour, 87% (n=593) \\nparticipated, and 85% (n=1,368) of controls in the whole study answered the \\nquestionnaire. The odds ratio (OR) for mobile phone use of the analogue type was \\n1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04‑3.3, increasing with >25 years of latency \\n(time since first exposure) to an OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.6-6.9.

With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone \\nstudies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the \\nSwedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of \\nsignificant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An \\nanalysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of \\na cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious \\ndesign flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient \\nlatency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young \\nadults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power \\nlevels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting \\nsources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the \\ncellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor \\ncases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and \\n(11) funding bias.

Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by \\n5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation \\noccurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly \\nlead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in \\nvitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a \\nsingle-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate \\nthat active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a \\nnucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start \\nsite (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in \\nRUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin \\nconfigurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is \\nmethylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically \\nmethylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures \\ncomprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG \\nisland promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that \\naberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to \\ntumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer \\nepigenetics.\"]\n",

The Recurrence Score (RS) provides a more accurate, reproducible \\nmeasure of breast cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic responsiveness than \\nstandard measures. Individualized patient management requires strict performance \\ncriteria for clinical laboratory tests. We therefore investigated the analytical \\nperformance of the assay.\\nMETHODS: Assays used a pooled RNA sample from fixed paraffin-embedded tissues to \\nevaluate the analytical performance of a 21-gene panel with respect to \\namplification efficiency, precision, linearity, and dynamic range, as well as \\nlimits of detection and quantification. Performance variables were estimated \\nfrom assays carried out with sample dilutions. In addition, individual patient \\nsamples were used to test the optimized assay for reproducibility and sources of \\nimprecision.\\nRESULTS: Assay results defined acceptable operational performance ranges, \\nincluding an estimated maximum deviation from linearity of <1 cycle threshold \\n(C(T)) units over a > or =2000-fold range of RNA concentrations, with a mean \\nquantification bias of 0.3% and CVs of 3.2%-5.7%. An analysis of study design \\nshowed that assay imprecision contributed by instrument, operator, reagent, and \\nday-to-day baseline variation was low, with SDs of <0.5 C(T).\\nCONCLUSION: The analytical and operational performance specifications defined \\nfor the Oncotype DX assay allow the reporting of quantitative RS values for \\nindividual patients with an SD within 2 RS units on a 100-unit scale.']\n",

Their aspect varies \\naccording to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time \\nthe hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a \\nsmall group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases \\nare also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system. \\nPathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by \\nthe presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the \\nbrainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, \\nparkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is \\ncortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or \\ndelusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse \\nLewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains \\nunclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.\", 'Diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies \\n(LB) in the neurons and neurites of cortical, subcortical, and brain stem \\nstructures. Recently, alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been found to be a central \\nconstituent of LB. In DLBD, abnormal accumulation of alphaS has been reported in \\nboth neurons and glia, but studies on glial lesions in DLBD have been limited. \\nWe examined in detail the constituents and distribution of glial lesions in \\neight patients with DLBD and report the pathogenesis of the glial lesions. \\nalphaS-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NI), neuropil threads (NT), and \\ncoiled bodies (CB) showed similar immunostaining profiles. Without pretreatment, \\nNI, NT, and CB were detected by all antibodies against alphaS. The \\nimmunostaining profile of star-like astrocytes (SLA) was quite different from \\nthose of NI, NT, and CB. A few SLA were stained by an antibody against the \\nnon-Abeta component portion of alphaS without pretreatment, but formic acid \\npretreatment dramatically enhanced SLA immunoreactivity. SLA and CB were found \\nin all eight brains with DLBD. SLA were scarce in the brain stem, but there were \\nhundreds of SLA per visual field at x100 magnification in the temporal cortex of \\nmost cases, while CB were found diffusely in both the cerebral cortex and brain \\nstem, similar to NI. This suggests that the pathogenesis of SLA is different \\nfrom those of NI and CB.', \"Lewy bodies, the characteristic pathological lesion of substantia nigra neurons \\nin Parkinson's disease (PD), are frequently observed to accompany the amyloid \\nplaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However \\nthe typical anatomic distribution of Lewy bodies in AD is distinct from PD. The \\nmost common site of occurrence is the amygdala, where Lewy bodies are observed \\nin approximately 60% of both sporadic and familial AD. Other common sites of \\noccurrence include the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortex, while neocortical \\nand brainstem areas develop Lewy bodies in a lower percentage of cases. In \\ncontrast, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), defined by widespread neocortical and \\nbrainstem Lewy bodies but frequently accompanied by variable levels of AD-type \\npathology, represents the other end of a spectrum of pathology associated with \\ndementia. The observation of Lewy bodies in familial AD cases suggests that like \\nneurofibrillary tangles, the formation of Lewy bodies can be induced by the \\npathological state caused by Abeta-amyloid overproduction. The role of Lewy body \\nformation in the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons remains unclear. The \\nprotein alpha-synuclein appears to be an important structural component of Lewy \\nbodies, an observation spurred by the discovery of point mutations in the \\nalpha-synuclein gene linked to rare cases of autosomal dominant PD. Further \\ninvestigation of alpha-synuclein and its relationship to pathological conditions \\npromoting Lewy body formation in AD, PD, and DLB may yield further insight into \\npathogenesis of these diseases.\"]\n",

This test \\nassigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a \\nbody-mass index of 25kg/m2 to less than 30kg/m2 or 5 points for having a \\nbody-mass index of 30kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being \\nolder than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.\\nRESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck \\ncircumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0% \\nof the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS \\nmodel for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the \\narea under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; \\n0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: \\n(0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability \\nof the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive \\npredictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for \\nmoderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the \\nsame cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe \\nOSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was \\nassociated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA \\nprobability for a score of 17.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with \\nspecificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. \\nFurthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of \\nmoderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this \\nscore can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the \\ndiagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy \\nof this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a \\npredominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease.']\n",

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes \\nsuggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are \\ngenerated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop \\nstructure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs \\nwere not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed \\nto be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some \\ncircRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of \\ntranscriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA \\ntranslation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with \\nprotein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CircPro is available at \\nhttp://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro.\\nCONTACT: mchen@zju.edu.cn.\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics \\nonline.\", 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and evolutionarily conserved RNAs of \\nlargely unknown function.

As a \\nmember of competitive endogenous RNA, it participates in the regulation of \\ncircRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and plays an important role in the regulation of \\nphysiology and pathology. CircRNA is produced by the reverse splicing of exon, \\nintron or both, forming exon or intron circRNA. Studies have shown that circRNA \\nis a ubiquitous molecule, which exceeds the linear mRNA distributed in human \\ncells. Because of its covalent closed-loop structure, circRNA is resistant to \\nRNase R, which is more stable than linear mRNA; circRNA is highly conserved in \\ndifferent species. It was found that circRNA competitively adsorbs miRNA, as a \\nmiRNA sponge, to involve in the expression regulation of a variety of genes and \\nplays an important role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis and other \\nprocesses. These molecules offer new potential opportunities for therapeutic \\nintervention and serve as biomarkers for diagnosis. In this paper, the origin, \\ncharacteristics and functions of circRNA and its role in tumor development, \\ninvasion and metastasis, diagnosis and prognosis are reviewed.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of regulatory RNAs that despite being \\nrelatively abundant have only recently begun to be explored. There are many \\nthousands of genes that appear capable of producing circRNAs, however the \\nfunction of all but a handful remain to be determined.

To clarify this situation, we analysed the role of T3 and \\nits receptors alpha1 (TRalpha1) and beta1 (TRbeta1) in regulation of KCNA4, \\nKCND2, KCND3 and KCNIP2 transcription in rat cardiomyocytes. Initial results \\ndemonstrated a T3-mediated increase of I(to) current density.

To dissect the role of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 in \\nT3-dependent I(to) modulation, TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 were overexpressed in \\ncardiomyocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. TRalpha1 increased I(to), \\nwhile TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with \\nTRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 \\ntranscription.

While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor \\nenhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 \\nexpression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 \\nstimulation. Deletion of the KCND3 5'-flanking region localized the suppressible \\npromoter sequence for TRbeta1 to within -293 bp and the activating promoter \\nsequence for TRalpha1 to within -2335 to -1654 bp of the transcription start \\nsite.

They vary widely in \\ntheir basic ecology; each virus occupies a distinct ecologic niche, often with \\nrestricted geographic and biologic distribution. As shown in Tables 54-1 and \\n54-2, alphaviruses and flaviviruses can cause various syndromes, ranging from \\nbenign febrile illnesses to severe systemic diseases with hemorrhagic \\nmanifestations or major organ involvement. The neurotropic alphaviruses and \\nflaviviruses can produce severe destructive central nervous system disease with \\nserious sequelae. Several alphaviruses (chikungunya, Mayaro, and Ross River) \\ncause painful arthritis that persists for weeks or months after the initial \\nfebrile illness. Yellow fever virus has unique hepatotropic properties that \\ncause a clinically and pathologically distinct form of hepatitis with a \\nhemorrhagic diathesis. The dengue viruses, which cause more human illness than \\nall other members of their family, may produce a serious, sometimes fatal, \\nimmunopathologic disease in which shock and hemorrhage occur. Hepatitis C virus \\n(Chapter 70) may be a flavivirus. Alphavirus is one of the two genera in the \\nfamily Togaviridae; the other genus (Rubivirus) has rubella virus (Chapter 55) \\nas its only member. Flavivirus, once classified in the Togaviridae, now \\nconstitutes one of three genera in the family Flaviviridae; the other two genera \\nare Pestivirus and “Hepatitis C-like viruses”. Pestivirus includes animal \\npathogens (bovine viral diarrhea and hog cholera viruses) that are of \\nconsiderable economic importance, but contains no known human pathogens. \\nHepatitis C virus is described in Chapter 70. All alphaviruses and flaviviruses \\nthat cause disease in humans are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In the \\noriginal classification scheme based on antigenic relationships, alphaviruses \\nand flaviviruses were termed group A and group B arboviruses, respectively. Most \\nalphaviruses and flaviviruses survive in nature by replicating alternately in a \\nvertebrate host and a hematophagous arthropod (mosquitoes or, for some \\nflaviviruses, ticks). Arthropod vectors acquire the viral infection by biting a \\nviremic host, and after an extrinsic incubation period during which the virus \\nreplicates in the vector's tissues, they transmit virus through salivary \\nsecretions to another vertebrate host. Virus replicates in the vertebrate host, \\ncausing viremia and sometimes illness. The ability to infect and replicate in \\nboth vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and \\nflaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of \\nwild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do \\nnot usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue \\nvirus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a \\nhuman-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and \\ncapable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause \\nwidespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential, \\nthese viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical \\nregions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because \\nsome of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious, \\nspecial containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required.\", 'Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to humans primarily \\nthrough the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks. West Nile virus (WNV) is the \\nleading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease in the United States. \\nHowever, several other arboviruses also cause sporadic cases and seasonal \\noutbreaks of neuroinvasive disease (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis, and acute \\nflaccid paralysis). This report summarizes surveillance data reported to CDC in \\n2013 for WNV and other nationally notifiable arboviruses, excluding dengue. \\nForty-seven states and the District of Columbia reported 2,469 cases of WNV \\ndisease. Of these, 1,267 (51%) were classified as WNV neuroinvasive disease, for \\na national incidence of 0.40 per 100,000 population. After WNV, the next most \\ncommonly reported cause of arboviral disease was La Crosse virus (LACV) (85 \\ncases), followed by Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), Powassan virus (POWV), and \\neastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (eight). WNV and other arboviruses \\ncontinue to cause serious illness in substantial numbers of persons annually. \\nMaintaining surveillance remains important to help direct and promote prevention \\nactivities.', 'The smallest of all the pathogens, viruses, have continuously been the foremost \\nstrange microorganisms. Viral infections can cause extreme sicknesses as \\nevidenced by the HIV/AIDS widespread or the later Ebola or Zika episodes. \\nApprehensive framework distortions are also regularly observed as consequences \\nof numerous viral infections. Besides, numerous viral infections are of \\noncoviruses, which can trigger different types of cancer. Nearly every year, a \\nmodern infectious species emerges, debilitating the world population with an \\nannihilating episode. Subsequently, there is a need to create antivirals to \\ncombat such rising infections. From the discovery of the antiviral drug \\nIdoxuridine in 1962 to the revelation of Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) that was \\napproved by the FDA in 2018, the whole process and criteria of creating \\nantivirals have changed significantly.

In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from \\nthe Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two \\ncryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial \\ncold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \\nfor children and adults 12 years and older. CAPS is a group of inherited \\ninflammatory disorders consisting of FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem \\ninflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as chronic infantile neurologic, \\ncutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous \\nmutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or \\ncryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent \\nof IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but \\nwith limited success.

The \\ninitial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS \\nsuggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID.

The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and \\ninterleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial \\ninvolving patients with recurrent pericarditis.\\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven, \\nrandomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of \\nrecurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic \\ninflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients \\npresenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were \\nenrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and \\nbackground medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response \\n(i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio \\nto receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered \\nsubcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox \\nproportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence. \\nSafety was also assessed.\\nRESULTS: A total of 86 patients with pericarditis pain and an elevated CRP level \\nwere enrolled in the run-in period. During the run-in period, the median time to \\nresolution or near-resolution of pain was 5 days, and the median time to \\nnormalization of the CRP level was 7 days. A total of 61 patients underwent \\nrandomization. During the randomized-withdrawal period, there were too few \\nrecurrence events in the rilonacept group to allow for the median time to the \\nfirst adjudicated recurrence to be calculated; the median time to the first \\nadjudicated recurrence in the placebo group was 8.6 weeks (95% confidence \\ninterval [CI], 4.0 to 11.7; hazard ratio in a Cox proportional-hazards model, \\n0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). During this period, 2 \\nof 30 patients (7%) in the rilonacept group had a pericarditis recurrence, as \\ncompared with 23 of 31 patients (74%) in the placebo group. In the run-in \\nperiod, 4 patients had adverse events leading to the discontinuation of \\nrilonacept therapy. The most common adverse events with rilonacept were \\ninjection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept led to rapid \\nresolution of recurrent pericarditis episodes and to a significantly lower risk \\nof pericarditis recurrence than placebo.

CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of \\ninterleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of \\nfunction mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is \\nsupported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions. \\nRilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug \\nAdministration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome \\nand Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for \\nlonger-acting IL-1 blockade.

However, the enzymes \\nresponsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. \\nHere we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions \\nas a tubulin deacetylase.

Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 \\npromotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated \\ndeacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility.

Although \\nligno-cellulosic material is considered as suitable feedstock, the almost \\ninevitable pretreatment of this recalcitrant material may interfere with the \\nsubsequent fermentation steps. In this study, the fungus Ustilago maydis was \\nused to produce itaconic acid as platform chemical for the synthesis of \\npotential biofuels such as 3-methyltetrahydrofuran. No studies, however, have \\ninvestigated how pretreatment of ligno-cellulosic biomass precisely influences \\nthe subsequent fermentation by U. maydis. Thus, this current study aims to first \\ncharacterize U. maydis in shake flasks and then to evaluate the influence of \\nthree exemplary pretreatment methods on the cultivation and itaconic acid \\nproduction of this fungus. Cellulose enzymatically hydrolysed in seawater and \\nsalt-assisted organic-acid catalysed cellulose were investigated as substrates. \\nLastly, hydrolysed hemicellulose from fractionated beech wood was applied as \\nsubstrate.\\nRESULTS: U. maydis was characterized on shake flask level regarding its itaconic \\nacid production on glucose. Nitrogen limitation was shown to be a crucial \\ncondition for the production of itaconic acid. For itaconic acid concentrations \\nabove 25 g/L, a significant product inhibition was observed. Performing \\nexperiments that simulated influences of possible pretreatment methods, U. \\nmaydis was only slightly affected by high osmolarities up to 3.5 osmol/L as well \\nas of 0.1 M oxalic acid. The production of itaconic acid was achieved on \\npretreated cellulose in seawater and on the hydrolysed hemicellulosic fraction \\nof pretreated beech wood.\\nCONCLUSION: The fungus U. maydis is a promising producer of itaconic acid, since \\nit grows as single cells (yeast-like) in submerged cultivations and it is \\nextremely robust in high osmotic media and real seawater. Moreover, U. maydis \\ncan grow on the hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. Thereby, this \\nfungus combines important advantages of yeasts and filamentous fungi. \\nNevertheless, the biomass pretreatment does indeed affect the subsequent \\nitaconic acid production. Although U. maydis is insusceptible to most possible \\nimpurities from pretreatment, high amounts of salts or residues of organic acids \\ncan slow microbial growth and decrease the production. Consequently, the \\npretreatment step needs to fit the prerequisites defined by the actual \\nmicroorganisms applied for fermentation.', \"Thirty fungal species grown on Cichorium intybus L. root extract as a sole \\ncarbon source, were screened for the production of exo-inulinase activities.

            "  - actual output: Yes, Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are considered good anticancer therapeutic targets. Initially, TAMs can exhibit antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or recruiting and activating other immune cells. However, as genetic changes occur within the tumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs can exhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune \\ncells in the TME. During initial stages of tumor development, macrophages can \\neither directly promote antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or indirectly \\nrecruit and activate other immune cells. As genetic changes occur within the \\ntumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to \\nexhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression, \\nmetastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting TAMs has emerged as a \\nstrategy for cancer therapy. To date, TAM targeting strategies have focused on \\nmacrophage depletion and inhibition of their recruitment into the TME. However, \\nthese strategies have shown limited therapeutic efficacy, although trials are \\nstill underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the \\npotential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the \\ndevelopment of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune \\nresponse. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their \\nimmunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint \\ninhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting \\nstrategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial \\nstages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.', 'In the last decade, it has been well-established that tumor-infiltrating myeloid \\ncells fuel not only the process of carcinogenesis through cancer-related \\ninflammation mechanisms, but also tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. \\nIn particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant \\nleucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a \\nprotective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an \\nimmune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to \\nallow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional \\ntherapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit \\ncancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also \\nresponsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint \\ninhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to \\ndeplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as \\nweapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the \\nreprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral \\nmacrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells. This \\nshift eventually leads to the reconstitution of a reactive immune landscape able \\nto destroy the tumor. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on \\nstrategies able to reprogram TAMs with single as well as combination therapies.', 'Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant innate immune \\ncells in tumors.

The DSM subdomain primarily interacts with the guanine tetrad through extensive van der Waals contacts, while the OB subdomain forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone phosphate groups of the guanine tract.

Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of \\nworms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA \\nsites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the \\nlinkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This \\npresent study also suggests that linkage of editing should be considered in \\nelucidating the functional consequences of RNA editing.', \"RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded \\nby genomic DNA.

Patients receiving \\nvolanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a \\nmean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence \\ninterval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), \\nwhereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride \\nlevels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per \\nliter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter]) \\n(P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as \\ncompared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of \\nless than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 \\npatients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of \\nthe patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo \\ngroup had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 \\npatients in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including 2 who had levels \\nbelow 25,000 per microliter. No patient had platelet counts below 50,000 per \\nmicroliter after enhanced platelet-monitoring began.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Volanesorsen lowered triglyceride levels to less than 750 mg per \\ndeciliter in 77% of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. \\nThrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions were common adverse events. \\n(Funded by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Akcea Therapeutics; APPROACH Clinical \\nTrials.gov number, NCT02211209.).', \"BACKGROUND: Volanesorsen, an investigational inhibitor of apoC-III synthesis, \\nsignificantly reduced triglyceride levels in clinical trials in patients with \\nfamilial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder characterized \\nby marked chylomicronemia leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including recurrent \\nabdominal pain and episodes of potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP).\\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of volanesorsen on burden of disease on \\npatients with FCS Methods: ReFOCUS was a retrospective global web-based survey \\nopen to patients with FCS who received volanesorsen for ≥3\\xa0months in an \\nopen-label extension study. The survey included questions about patients' \\nexperiences before and after volanesorsen treatment.\\nRESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of \\n222\\xa0days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient \\nacross physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from \\nbaseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry \\nabout an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved \\noverall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school \\nresponsibilities.

The \\ntheory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is \\nnot random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine \\ncontent of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral \\nparts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA \\nsequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of \\nneutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined \\nparameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants \\nwere discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all \\norganisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers \\nplausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine \\ncontent among different parts of the vertebrate genome.', 'When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of \\nDNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six \\n(type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is \\nexpected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C \\ncontent of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the \\nparity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result \\nmostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two \\nstrands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for \\nevaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional \\nmutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational \\nbiases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias \\nmutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional \\nselection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis \\nshows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of \\nfour-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C \\ncontent of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly \\ncounteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C \\ncontent.', 'Directional mutation pressure associated with replication processes is the main \\ncause of the asymmetry between the leading and lagging DNA strands in bacterial \\ngenomes. On the other hand, the asymmetry between sense and antisense strands of \\nprotein coding sequences is a result of both mutation and selection pressures. \\nThus, there are two different ways of superposition of the sense strand, on the \\nleading or lagging strand. Besides many other implications of these two possible \\nsituations, one seems to be very important - because of the asymmetric \\nreplication-associated mutation pressure, the mutation rate of genes depends on \\ntheir location. Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under \\nexperimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and \\nthe elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the \\nleading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome. We have found \\nthat the best survival strategy for the majority of genes is to sometimes switch \\nbetween DNA strands. Paradoxically, this strategy results in higher substitution \\nrates but remains in agreement with observations in bacterial genomes that such \\ninversions are very frequent and divergence rate between homologs lying on \\ndifferent DNA strands is very high.']\n",

Predicting performance prior to BCI \\nuse would facilitate selection of the most feasible system for an individual, \\nthus constitute a practical benefit for the user, and increase our knowledge \\nabout the correlates of BCI control. In a recent study, we predicted SMR-BCI \\nperformance from psychological variables that were assessed prior to the BCI \\nsessions and BCI control was supported with machine-learning techniques.

However, an additional role for the N-terminal 70 \\namino acids (N70), derived from multiubiquitination factor Ube4b, has not been \\nexcluded. In wild-type Ube4b, N70 is part of a sequence essential for \\nubiquitination activity but its role is not understood. We report direct binding \\nof N70 to valosin-containing protein (VCP; p97/Cdc48), a protein with diverse \\ncellular roles including a pivotal role in the ubiquitin proteasome system. \\nInteraction with Wld(S) targets VCP to discrete intranuclear foci where \\nubiquitin epitopes can also accumulate. Wld(S) lacking its N-terminal 16 amino \\nacids (N16) neither binds nor redistributes VCP, but continues to accumulate in \\nintranuclear foci, targeting its intrinsic NAD(+) synthesis activity to these \\nsame foci. Wild-type Ube4b also requires N16 to bind VCP, despite a more \\nC-terminal binding site in invertebrate orthologues. We conclude that N-terminal \\nsequences of Wld(S) protein influence the intranuclear location of both \\nubiquitin proteasome and NAD(+) synthesis machinery and that an evolutionary \\nrecent sequence mediates binding of mammalian Ube4b to VCP.']\n",

In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several \\ntreatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the \\ninstallation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting \\nmaterials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless, \\nmembrane perforations represent the most common complication among these \\nprocedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the \\nrelevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications.\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed \\nby two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, \\nand Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018 \\nreporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without \\nregenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft \\nmaterial.

With lipidomics datasets \\nbecoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required \\nto facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating \\nlipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and \\nunsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source \\nR/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. \\nlipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for \\ntargeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline \\nexports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically \\ninferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through \\nintegration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and \\nreanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data \\ninspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying \\nresults as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, \\nchain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a \\nnovel lipid set enrichment analysis. A companion online guide with two live \\nexample datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/. We expect that the \\nease of use and innovative features of lipidr will allow the lipidomics research \\ncommunity to gain novel detailed insights from lipidomics data.', 'High resolution LC-MS untargeted lipidomics using data independent acquisition \\n(DIA) has the potential to increase lipidome coverage, as it enables the \\ncontinuous and unbiased acquisition of all eluting ions. However, the loss of \\nthe link between the precursor and the product ions combined with the high \\ndimensionality of DIA data sets hinder accurate feature annotation. Here, we \\npresent LipidMS, an R package aimed to confidently identify lipid species in \\nuntargeted LC-DIA-MS. To this end, LipidMS combines a coelution score, which \\nlinks precursor and fragment ions with fragmentation and intensity rules. \\nDepending on the MS evidence reached by the identification function survey, \\nLipidMS provides three levels of structural annotations: (i) \"subclass level\", \\ne.g., PG(34:1); (ii) \"fatty acyl level\", e.g., PG(16:0_18:1); and (iii) \"fatty \\nacyl position level\", e.g., PG(16:0/18:1). The comparison of LipidMS with freely \\navailable data dependent acquisition (DDA) and DIA identification tools showed \\nthat LipidMS provides significantly more accurate and structural informative \\nlipid identifications. Finally, to exemplify the utility of LipidMS, we \\ninvestigated the lipidomic serum profile of patients diagnosed with nonalcoholic \\nsteatohepatitis (NASH), which is the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty \\nliver disease, a disorder underlying a strong lipid dysregulation. As previously \\npublished, a significant decrease in lysophosphatidylcholines, \\nphosphatidylcholines and cholesterol esters and an increase in \\nphosphatidylethanolamines were observed in NASH patients. Remarkably, LipidMS \\nallowed the identification of a new set of lipids that may be used for NASH \\ndiagnosis.

Lipid Mini-On \\nuses a text-mining process to bin individual lipid names into multiple lipid \\nontology groups based on the classification (e.g. LipidMaps) and other \\ncharacteristics, such as chain length. Lipid Mini-On provides users with the \\ncapability to conduct enrichment analysis of the lipid ontology terms using a \\nShiny app with options of five statistical approaches. Lipid classes can be \\nadded to customize the user's database and remain updated as new lipid classes \\nare discovered. Visualization of results is available for all classification \\noptions (e.g. lipid subclass and individual fatty acid chains).

The models developed by \\ndifferent researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different \\nsets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a \\nsingle model with good predictive values. One of the main reasons for this \\nchallenge is related to relatively large size of the active sites and \\nflexibility of the CYP isoenzymes, which results in multiple binding sites. We \\npropose development of multiple- diverse pharmacophore models for each binding \\nmode (as opposed to a single predictive model for each CYP isoenzyme). After \\nscoring and prioritization of the models, we propose the use of a battery of \\npharmacophore models for each CYP isoenzyme binding mode to computationally \\nobtain a P450 interaction profile for drug candidates early in the drug \\ndevelopment cycle, when decisions on their fate can be made before incurring the \\ncosts of synthesis and testing.', 'Cytochrome P450 (P450) 17A enzymes play a critical role in the oxidation of the \\nsteroids progesterone (Prog) and pregnenolone (Preg) to glucocorticoids and \\nandrogens.

Teleost fish contain two 17A P450s; zebrafish P450 17A1 catalyzes both \\n17α-hydroxylation and lyase reactions with Prog and Preg, and P450 17A2 is more \\nefficient in pregnenolone 17α-hydroxylation but does not catalyze the lyase \\nreaction, even in the presence of cytochrome b5. P450 17A2 binds all substrates \\nand products, although more loosely than P450 17A1. Pulse-chase and kinetic \\nspectral experiments and modeling established that the two-step P450 17A1 Prog \\noxidation is more distributive than the Preg reaction, i.e. 17α-OH product \\ndissociates more prior to the lyase step. The drug orteronel selectively blocked \\nthe lyase reaction of P450 17A1 but only in the case of Prog. X-ray crystal \\nstructures of zebrafish P450 17A1 and 17A2 were obtained with the ligand \\nabiraterone and with Prog for P450 17A2.

Although \\nthe search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on \\nfor about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based \\non our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions \\nto predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between \\nour approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal \\nDNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of \\npyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., \\nYYRR versus RYRY); (iii) we postulate that alternating AT-rich and GC-rich \\nmotifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and DNA \\nin the minor groove. Using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions \\nmapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, \\nthe pGUB plasmid, chicken beta-globin and three 5S rDNA genes). We predicted 15 \\nof the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. \\nThe predicted position of the '601' nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the \\ncomputed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by \\nno more than 1 bp - an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. Our \\nanalysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be \\ndivided into two groups based on the positioning 'rules' they follow. The \\nsequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable YR/YYRR motifs at the \\nminor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the \\nalpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the \\npositioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between \\nhistones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group \\n(that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at \\nthe sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the \\ncentral part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the \\npositioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these \\nnucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures.

Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common \\nexperimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of \\nmicrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase \\nin combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the \\nresulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and \\nespecially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a \\nconsequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major \\ndeterminant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show \\nthat data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched \\ncontrol experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.', 'Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, \\nquantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales.

It \\nhas been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the \\nexisting algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the \\nshortest ones.\\nRESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the \\ndata, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent \\nwords, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words \\nintroduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \\nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \\nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \\nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An \\nimplementation of this algorithm is publicly available at \\nftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws.\\nCONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much \\nlarger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful \\nfor applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, \\nthe number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most \\nlinearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow \\nexponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed \\nadditional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing \\nstudies on the topic.']\n",

To further analyze \\nCobB-regulated sites under conditions of globally increased or decreased \\nacetylation, we measured stoichiometry in phophotransacetylase (ptaΔ) and \\nacetate kinase (ackAΔ) mutant strains in the presence and absence of the Sirtuin \\ninhibitor nicotinamide. We measured acetylation stoichiometry at 3,669 unique \\nsites and found that the vast majority of acetylation occurred at a low \\nstoichiometry. Manipulations that cause increased nonenzymatic acetylation by \\nacetyl-phosphate (AcP), such as stationary-phase arrest and deletion of ackA, \\nresulted in globally increased acetylation stoichiometry. Comparison to relative \\nquantification under the same conditions validated our stoichiometry estimates \\nat hundreds of sites, demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Similar to \\nSirtuin deacetylase 3 (SIRT3) in mitochondria, CobB suppressed acetylation to \\nlower than median stoichiometry in WT, ptaΔ, and ackAΔ cells. Together, our \\nresults provide a detailed view of acetylation stoichiometry in E. coli and \\nsuggest an evolutionarily conserved function of Sirtuin deacetylases in \\nsuppressing low stoichiometry acetylation.']\n",

Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function \\nand regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR \\ncomplexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions, \\nwe found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in \\nthe cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary \\nfibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the \\nmTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor \\ncomplex is abundant in both compartments. Rapamycin negatively regulates the \\nformation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on \\nmTORC2 remained elusive. We describe that in primary cells short-term treatment \\nwith rapamycin triggers dephosphorylation of rictor and sin1 exclusively in the \\ncytoplasm, but does not affect mTORC2 assembly. Prolonged drug treatment leads \\nto complete dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear rictor \\nand sin1 accompanied by inhibition of mTORC2 assembly. The distinct cytoplasmic \\nand nuclear upstream and downstream effectors of mTOR are involved in many \\ncancers and human genetic diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers \\nsyndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, polycystic kidney \\ndisease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and diabetes. \\nAccordingly, analogs of rapamycin are currently tested in many different \\nclinical trials. Our data allow new insights into the molecular consequences of \\nmTOR dysregulation under pathophysiological conditions and should help to \\noptimize rapamycin treatment of human diseases.\", 'The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important \\nregulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1, \\nconsisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed \\nmTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion \\nof mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K \\n(S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB \\n(protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we \\nreport that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1 \\n(protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are \\ncomponents of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or \\nProtor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not \\nRaptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton \\nX-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1, \\nSin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression \\nof Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 \\nsubunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2, \\nbut further work is required to establish its role.', 'The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important \\nregulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in \\ncancer.

There are seven \\nmembers in the human Hes family, Hes1-7, which are expressed in many tissues and \\nplay various roles mainly in development. All Hes proteins have three conserved \\ndomains: basic HLH (bHLH), Orange, and WRPW domains. The basic region binds to \\ntarget DNA sequences, while the HLH region forms homo- and heterodimers with \\nother bHLH proteins, the Orange domain is responsible for the selection of \\npartners during heterodimer formation, and the WRPW domain recruits \\ncorepressors. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of \\ncanonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell \\ninteraction. Hes factors regulate many events in development by repressing the \\nexpression of target genes, many of which encode transcriptional activators that \\npromote cell differentiation.

Recently, it was shown that the expression dynamics of \\nHes1 plays crucial roles in proper developmental timings and fate-determination \\nsteps of embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells.

Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely \\nlow frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the \\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency \\ntechnology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has \\ngenerated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate \\nthe relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of \\nthe head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the \\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. \\nThis publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study.\\nMETHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and \\ncentral nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. \\nEligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly \\ndiagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The \\ndiagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal \\nradiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and \\nplace of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed \\ninformation was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted \\nface-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the \\nodds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of \\neach type of cancer.\\nRESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of \\nneuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95% \\nconfidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence \\ninterval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant, \\na general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the \\nheaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of \\ntelephones.\\nCONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was \\nobserved among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical \\npower of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility \\nof an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in \\nthe international INTERPHONE analyses.', 'BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in \\nrelation to the use of wireless phones.\\nMETHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour \\n(n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date \\nof diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012.\\nRESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones) \\ngave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with > \\n10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02).

With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone \\nstudies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the \\nSwedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of \\nsignificant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An \\nanalysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of \\na cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious \\ndesign flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient \\nlatency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young \\nadults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power \\nlevels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting \\nsources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the \\ncellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor \\ncases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and \\n(11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish \\nstudies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10).

Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA \\nmethylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority \\ndo not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription \\nsilencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by \\n5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation \\noccurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly \\nlead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in \\nvitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a \\nsingle-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate \\nthat active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a \\nnucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start \\nsite (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in \\nRUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin \\nconfigurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is \\nmethylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically \\nmethylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures \\ncomprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG \\nisland promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that \\naberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to \\ntumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer \\nepigenetics.\", \"Regulated expression of a gene of interest is crucial for transgenic research, \\nas well as for safe and efficacious gene therapy. The most commonly used \\nconditional expression system requires the generation of two transgenic strains, \\none carrying an inducible promoter and the other a transactivator. The \\ngeneration of conditional transgenic models using this method is costly and time \\nconsuming. In this study, we report the design and construction of novel \\nsimplified gene delivery vectors that integrate both the regulatory and \\nresponsive elements in a single vector. The Tet-On system was used and \\nintegrated the inducible promoter and transactivator in a single plasmid, \\nbetween which a copy of an insulator was inserted to minimize interference \\nbetween the two units. Another copy of an insulator was inserted upstream of the \\ntransgene cassette to eliminate transgene silencing and to lower basal \\nexpression. The two insulators were in the same orientation. To further decrease \\nbasal expression, the most powerful repressor domain containing a \\n'kruppel-associated box' of the zinc finger protein NK10 was used and fused to \\nTetR in one of the two vectors. The function of this system was confirmed after \\nin?vitro transient transfection. The two conditional plasmids were successfully \\nconstructed, and the expression of the gene of interest was regulated tightly in \\nvitro. In conclusion, the vectors described here may be useful for gene therapy \\napplications, as well as for the establishment of conditional animal models.\", 'The promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates \\ntranscription initiation of the gene. Accurate identification of promoters is \\nessential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental \\nmethods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate \\ncomputational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of \\nmethods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to \\nidentify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA).

A recent technique, paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) blot, \\nretains the superior protein detection and anatomical resolution of histoblot \\nand is applicable to formalin-fixed tissues. Unfortunately, a major obstacle to \\nthe widespread application of PET is the lack of a detailed methodological \\ndescription. In this paper, we describe a PET blotting method that was \\nformulated from our own empirical and experimental research in Alzheimer disease \\nand a systematic review of the current literature. From this, we conclude that \\nPET can be applied to a variety of conditions with a wide spectrum of pathology.', 'Recently, recommendations for the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen \\nreceptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into \\nguidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National \\nComprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which \\nmeasures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of \\ndisease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond \\nto chemotherapy. Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004 \\nand has been used for more than 85,000 patients. Drs. William J. Gradishar, Nora \\nM.

The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference, \\nObesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily \\nemployed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease. \\nThe score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if \\nthey have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher.\\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool \\nfor the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic.\\nMETHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by \\nprimary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had \\nundergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test \\nassigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a \\nbody-mass index of 25kg/m2 to less than 30kg/m2 or 5 points for having a \\nbody-mass index of 30kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being \\nolder than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.\\nRESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck \\ncircumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0% \\nof the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS \\nmodel for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the \\narea under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; \\n0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: \\n(0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability \\nof the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive \\npredictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for \\nmoderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the \\nsame cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe \\nOSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was \\nassociated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA \\nprobability for a score of 17.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with \\nspecificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. \\nFurthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of \\nmoderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this \\nscore can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the \\ndiagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy \\nof this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a \\npredominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease.', 'BACKGROUND: Since the clinical presentation of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome \\n(OSAS) shares common features with major depressive (MDE), the screening of OSAS \\nis challenging in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the \\neffectiveness of the NoSAS score in predicting the presence of OSAS among \\nparticipants with current MDE and to compare it with the performance of existing \\nscreening tools.\\nMETHODS: A random sample of the population-based cohort CoLaus (Lausanne, \\nSwitzerland) underwent a psychiatric evaluation (PsyCoLaus) and a complete \\npolysomnography at home (HypnoLaus). The effectiveness of the NoSAS score in \\ndetecting the risk of significant OSAS among current MDE participants was \\nassessed and compared with STOP-BANG and Berlin scores.\\nRESULTS: Among the 1761 subjects (58,75 ± 11y.o.; 47,8%men) who underwent \\npolysomnography, significant OSAS was present in 24.0% with and 26.1% without \\ncurrent MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in \\nMDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative \\npredictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area \\nunder the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the \\nBerlin score (NS).\\nLIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The \\nstudied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening \\ntools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool \\nfor OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.', 'BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight \\nrecordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low \\navailability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is \\nrecommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of \\nindividuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing.\\nMETHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in \\nLausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at \\nhome, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis \\nand logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant \\nsleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an \\nindependent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing \\nscreening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores).\\nFINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were \\nassessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges \\nfrom 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 \\ncm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2) \\nor 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for \\nsnoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being \\nmale. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified \\nindividuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with \\nan area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even \\nhigher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85). The \\nNoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95% \\nCI 0·65-0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61-0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.\\nINTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement \\nscore enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered \\nbreathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help \\nclinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal \\nrecording.\\nFUNDING: Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne, Lausanne \\nUniversity Hospital, Swiss National Science Foundation, Leenaards Foundation, \\nGlaxoSmithKline, and Vaud Pulmonary League.']\n",

For \\nmonocular conditions, movements of the covered eye were also recorded (open-loop \\ntesting). Bivariate contour ellipses (BCEAs), representing the region over which \\neye positions were found 68.2% of the time, were calculated and normalized by \\nlog transformation.\\nRESULTS: For controls, there were no differences between eyes. Binocular PS \\n(log(10)BCEA = -0.88) was better than monocular PS (log(10)BCEA = -0.59) \\nindicating binocular summation, and the PS of the viewing eye was better than \\nthat of the covered eye (log(10)BCEA = -0.33). For patients, the amblyopic eye \\nexhibited a significant decrease in PS during amblyopic eye (log(10)BCEA = \\n-0.20), fellow eye (log(10)BCEA = 0.0004), and binocular (log(10)BCEA = -0.44) \\nviewing. The PS of the fellow eye depended on viewing condition: it was \\ncomparable to controls during binocular (log(10)BCEA = -0.77) and fellow eye \\nviewing (log(10)BCEA = -0.52), but it decreased during amblyopic eye viewing \\n(log(10)BCEA = 0.08). Patients exhibited binocular summation during fellow eye \\nviewing, but not during amblyopic eye viewing. Decrease in PS in patients was \\nmainly due to slow eye drifts.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Deficits in spatiotemporal vision in amblyopia are associated with \\npoor PS. PS of amblyopic and fellow eyes is differentially affected depending on \\nviewing condition.', 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial \\ntopography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling, \\ncombined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for \\nthe management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring.\\nMETHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both \\ncorneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45 \\nyears ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity \\n(CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the \\nright eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: \\n42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the \\nrecommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We \\ndecided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol \\n(combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February \\n2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was \\ndesigned on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.\\nRESULTS: Fifteen months after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had \\nimproved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrected distance \\nvisual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°. We \\nnoted a similar outcome after similar treatment applied in the left eye with \\nUDVA 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with -0.50, -2.00 at 170° at the 8-month follow-up.\\nCONCLUSION: In this case, the introduction of successful management of severe \\ncornea abnormalities and scarring with the Athens Protocol may provide an \\neffective alternative to other existing surgical or medical options.', 'Amblyopia is defined as reduced and uncorrectable vision in a structurally \\nnormal eye. Early detection of amblyopia is very important. This can be \\naccomplished through screening programs designed to identify amblyopia risk \\nfactors. Testing can be performed by trained teachers, technicians, school \\nnurses and pediatricians as well as by eye care professionals. Once a child is \\nidentified as having an amblyopia risk factor it is crucial that the parents \\nfollow up with a pediatric ophthalmologist for a comprehensive examination. \\nAmblyopia is the leading cause of monocular vision loss in the United States for \\nadults under the age of 40.

The \\nFlaviviridae family consists of 3 genera which include the Flavivirus genus \\n(type species, yellow fever virus) as the largest genus, the Hepacivirus (type \\nspecies, hepatitis C virus) and the Pestivirus (type species, bovine virus \\ndiarrhea). The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted \\nby mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to \\npropagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne. \\nDespite the extensive research and public health concern associated with \\nflavivirus diseases, to date, there is no specific treatment available for any \\nflavivirus infections, though commercially available vaccines for yellow fever, \\nJapanese encephalitis and tick-born encephalitis exist. Due to the global threat \\nof viral pandemics, there is an urgent need for new drugs. In many countries, \\npatients with severe cases of flavivirus infections are treated only by \\nsupportive care, which includes intravenous fluids, hospitalization, respiratory \\nsupport, and prevention of secondary infections. This review discusses the \\nstrategies used towards the discovery of antiviral drugs, focusing on rational \\ndrug design against Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese \\nencephalitis virus (JEV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). \\nOnly modified peptidic, nonpeptidic, natural compounds and fragment-based \\ninhibitors (typically of mass less than 300 Da) against structural and \\nnon-structural proteins are discussed.', 'There are 219 virus species that are known to be able to infect humans. The \\nfirst of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to \\nfour new species are still being found every year. Extrapolation of the \\ndiscovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered \\nhuman virus species, although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of \\nspecies from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of \\ndiversity. More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human \\nhosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also \\nhave mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian \\nviruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although \\nonly around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around \\nhalf again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible \\npredictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of \\nphylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new \\nhuman viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for \\nthe foreseeable future. For this reason, an effective global surveillance system \\nfor novel viruses is needed.', 'Filoviruses are zoonotic and among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with \\nmortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%.

These \\nagents differ in terms of their effectiveness for controlling specific rheumatic \\ndiseases depending on the pivotal cytokine driving the inflammatory process. \\nCytokine blockers were the first to be developed and rapidly expanded. They \\ninclude agents that act against tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α) (etanercept, \\ninfliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and interleukin (IL) \\n6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL‑1 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept), \\nIL‑17 (secukinumab and ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) receptors. \\nLymphocyte‑targeting agents include rituximab and belimumab, which act against B \\ncells by different mechanisms, and abatacept, which is a T cell costimulation \\nmodulator. tsDMARDs, also known as small‑molecule inhibitors, are oral drugs \\nbased on a novel strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) \\ninhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) and phosphodiesterase 4 \\ninhibitors (apremilast) form this group. The major concern with the use of \\nbDMARDs and tsDMARDs is a higher risk of infections.

There have been \\nlimited data on the use of these drugs during pregnancy, but anti‑TNF‑α therapy, \\nrituximab, and anakinra seem to be safe. Biologic agents are expensive, but \\nbiosimilars have emerged as a cost‑effective option with a potential to treat a \\ngreater number of patients.\", 'Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker \\ndeveloped by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a \\njoint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment \\nof rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of \\nphase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited \\nbenefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from \\nthe Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two \\ncryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial \\ncold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \\nfor children and adults 12 years and older. CAPS is a group of inherited \\ninflammatory disorders consisting of FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem \\ninflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as chronic infantile neurologic, \\ncutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous \\nmutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or \\ncryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent \\nof IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but \\nwith limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta, \\ninitially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/ \\nAmgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in \\nCAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of \\nthese conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by \\ncytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer \\nhalf-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not \\ntolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The \\ninitial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS \\nsuggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet \\nto be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other \\nchronic inflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever and \\nsystemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.', 'Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a subgroup of the hereditary \\nperiodic fever syndromes, which are rare autoinflammatory and inherited \\ndisorders, characterized by recurrent inflammation and varying degrees of \\nseverity. CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of \\ninterleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of \\nfunction mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is \\nsupported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions. \\nRilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug \\nAdministration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome \\nand Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for \\nlonger-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in \\ndisease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid \\nA (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept \\nin CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept \\nis also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an \\nextended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring \\nweekly rather than daily self-administration. Other autoinflammatory disorders \\nmay also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for \\nsystemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, gout and familial mediterranean \\nfever.']\n",

At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial \\nfor various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity, \\nlearning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent \\nmodifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated \\nwith stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past \\nthree decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively.

In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates \\nalpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 \\npromotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated \\ndeacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility.

During initial stages of tumor development, macrophages can \\neither directly promote antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or indirectly \\nrecruit and activate other immune cells. As genetic changes occur within the \\ntumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to \\nexhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression, \\nmetastasis, and resistance to therapy.

The fact that macrophages have the \\npotential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the \\ndevelopment of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune \\nresponse. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their \\nimmunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint \\ninhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting \\nstrategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial \\nstages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.', 'In the last decade, it has been well-established that tumor-infiltrating myeloid \\ncells fuel not only the process of carcinogenesis through cancer-related \\ninflammation mechanisms, but also tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. \\nIn particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant \\nleucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a \\nprotective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an \\nimmune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to \\nallow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional \\ntherapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit \\ncancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also \\nresponsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint \\ninhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to \\ndeplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as \\nweapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the \\nreprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral \\nmacrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells. This \\nshift eventually leads to the reconstitution of a reactive immune landscape able \\nto destroy the tumor. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on \\nstrategies able to reprogram TAMs with single as well as combination therapies.', 'Cancer therapy has developed around the concept of killing, or stopping the \\ngrowth of, the cancer cells. Molecularly targeted therapy is the modern \\nexpression of this paradigm. Increasingly, however, the realization that the \\ncancer has co-opted the normal cells of the stroma for its own survival has led \\nto the concept that the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be targeted for \\neffective therapy. In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated \\nmacrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to \\ncancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the \\nmajor phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer \\ntreatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor \\nangiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many \\npreclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation \\nand anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs \\nfrom tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype. \\nThe data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting \\nTAMs with conventional therapy.

In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for \\nprimitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in \\ndefinitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we \\nreport the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi \\nfactor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and \\ndefinitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses \\ndemonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive \\nand definitive hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. Loss of gfi1aa silences \\nmarkers of early primitive progenitors, scl and gata1. Conversely, loss of gfi1b \\nsilences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for \\ndefinitive hematopoiesis. We determine the epistatic relationships between the \\ngfi factors and key hematopoietic transcription factors, demonstrating that \\ngfi1aa and gfi1b join lmo2, scl, runx-1 and c-myb as critical regulators of \\nteleost HSPC. Our studies establish a comparative paradigm for the regulation of \\nhematopoietic lineages by gfi transcription factors.', 'In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified \\nthat the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly \\nrestricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 \\nand Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc \\nfinger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid \\nmalignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been \\nwell characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human \\nhematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic \\nprogenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an \\nerythropoietin-independent manner. Expression of Gfi-1B did not promote \\nerythroid commitment, but enhanced proliferation of immature erythroblasts. \\nErythroblasts expanded by exogenous Gfi-1B, however, failed to differentiate \\nbeyond proerythroblast stage and showed massive apoptosis. These biologic \\neffects of Gfi-1B were mediated through its zinc finger domain, but not by the \\nSNAG or non-zinc finger domain. Proliferation of erythroblasts was associated \\nwith sustained expression of GATA-2 but not of GATA-1, indicating a potential \\nlink between Gfi-1B and GATA family regulators. Importantly, the function of \\nGfi-1B to modulate transcription was dependent on promoter context. In addition, \\nactivation of transcription of an artificial promoter was mediated through its \\nzinc finger domain. These findings establish Gfi-1B as a novel erythroid \\nregulator and reveal its specific involvement in the regulation of erythroid \\ncell growth through modulating erythroid-specific gene expression.', 'Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential \\nfor erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in \\nmice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive \\nerythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We \\nhere show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and \\nmegakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent \\nerythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population \\nthe type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct \\ntarget of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth \\nfactor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2 \\nphosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary \\nfactor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to \\nspecifically regulate erythroid differentiation, we propose that, by repressing \\nTGF-beta type III receptor (TbetaRIotaII) expression, Gfi-1B favors the \\nSmad2/TIF1-gamma interaction downstream of TGF-beta signaling, allowing immature \\nprogenitors to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage.']\n",

It has an extremely high affinity for both DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s), which are alternative nucleic acid structures that influence various cellular pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. DHX36 is consistently found bound to G-quadruplexes in cells and is a major source of G-quadruplex unfolding activity in HeLa cell lysates. It is involved in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and is essential for heart development, haematopoiesis, and embryogenesis in mice. The unwinding of G4s by DHX36 is crucial to maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation initiation. The thermodynamic stability of G4 substrates affects the rates of unwinding by DHX36, but the ATPase activity of the helicase is largely independent of substrate stability, suggesting a decoupling mechanism similar to that of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) on double-stranded substrates.\n",

We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally \\nsophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of\\xa0thousands of evolutionarily \\nconserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules \\npertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence \\nflanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers \\na selective advantage. Due to the large\\xa0number of sites, the surrounding \\nconservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms \\nin protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and \\ntranscriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy \\nfor diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function. \\nPAPERCLIP.', \"RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded \\nby genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many \\neukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral \\nprotein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing \\n(adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear \\nto be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis \\nof cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by \\nanciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some \\nadaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an \\nindependently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding \\nof their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine \\nwhether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates \\nderived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and \\nfungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in \\ninferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by \\ndeeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is \\nan increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest \\nfundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA \\nediting in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.\", 'The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically \\ncharacterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in \\nclusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend \\nto be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally \\ndesigned to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the \\neditomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in \\nDrosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two \\nclades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be \\nassociated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural \\nselection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we \\nonly detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which \\nwere not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of \\nworms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA \\nsites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the \\nlinkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This \\npresent study also suggests that linkage of editing should be considered in \\nelucidating the functional consequences of RNA editing.']\n",

Now that DNA \\nsequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of \\nneutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined \\nparameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants \\nwere discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all \\norganisms are subject to directional mutation pressure.

An \\nintermediate type is also increasingly being described. Inheritance can be \\nautosomal-dominant (AD), X-linked, or autosomal-recessive (AR). AD CMT1 is the \\nmost common type of CMT and was the first form of CMT in which a causative gene \\nwas described. This review provides an up-to-date overview of AD CMT1 \\nconcentrating on the molecular genetics as the clinical, neurophysiological, and \\npathological features have been covered elsewhere. Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, \\nLITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI \\nand a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also \\ncause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria). Studies have shown many of these \\ngenes, when mutated, can cause a wide range of CMT phenotypes from the \\nrelatively mild CMT1 to the more severe Dejerine-Sottas disease and congenital \\nhypomyelinating neuropathy, and even in some cases axonal CMT2.

In this \\nstudy, we have identified the mutations in two pccB, one pccC, and two pccBC \\ncell lines and have deduced those alleles participating in interallelic \\ncomplementation.

(b) What are EV impacts on skin inflammatory disease physiopathology? (iii) \\nWhat are the possible and expected clinical applications of EVs to treat \\ninflammatory skin diseases?', 'A range of bacteria and archaea produce intracellular gas-filled proteinaceous \\nstructures that function as flotation devices in order to maintain a suitable \\ndepth in the aqueous environment. The wall of these gas vesicles is freely \\npermeable to gas molecules and is composed of a small hydrophobic protein, GvpA, \\nwhich forms a single-layer wall. In addition, several minor structural, \\naccessory or regulatory proteins are required for gas vesicle formation. In \\ndifferent organisms, 8-14 genes encoding gas vesicle proteins have been \\nidentified, and their expression has been shown to be regulated by environmental \\nfactors. In this Review, I describe the basic properties of gas vesicles, the \\ngenes that encode them and how their production is regulated. I also discuss the \\nfunction of these vesicles and the initial attempts to exploit them for \\nbiotechnological purposes.']\n",

The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is \\ncritical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK \\ncatalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique \\nfunctions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links \\nbetween AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG \\nassociation of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative \\nSG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, \\noverexpression of mutant α-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG \\nparameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-α2 \\nbinding partner.

The \\nRSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the \\nprion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in \\nresponse to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits \\nits nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal \\ndomain. Nuclear accumulation is dependent on TIA-1. Surprisingly, nuclear \\nlocalization of RSK2 is sufficient to enhance proliferation through induction of \\ncyclin D1, in the absence of other active signaling pathways. Hence, RSK2 is a \\npivotal factor linking the stress response to survival and proliferation.', 'Mechanical stress is known to activate signaling cascades, including \\nmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.

CLN2 is characterised by progressive \\nimpairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness \\nand early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has \\nbeen shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article \\nsummarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its \\nfirst global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in \\npaediatric patients ≥3\\xa0years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU \\nfor CLN2 in all ages.', 'BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an \\nenzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid \\nlipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes \\nprogressive dementia in children.\\nMETHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of \\nintraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with \\nCLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was \\ninitiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received \\nthe 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a \\n2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 \\nClinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function \\nand 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was \\ncompared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We \\nalso compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two \\ngroups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more \\nthan 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks).\\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy \\npopulation. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score \\nwas not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. \\nThe mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per \\n48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in \\n42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001).

From the facts \\nthat these suppressors map at positions quite similar to the UPF2, UPF3 and UPF1 \\ngenes, respectively, and that some mutations in the UPF genes confer termination \\nsuppressor activity, we suspected that sup111, sup112 and sup113 would very well \\nbe mutant alleles of the UPF genes.

These treatment alternatives aimed at the \\ninstallation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting \\nmaterials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless, \\nmembrane perforations represent the most common complication among these \\nprocedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the \\nrelevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications.\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed \\nby two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, \\nand Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018 \\nreporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without \\nregenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft \\nmaterial.

BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or \\nregions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files.

Further studies showed that HuR interacted with \\nthe 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased \\nthe cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript, \\nas well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both \\nparameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was \\naccompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic \\nLuc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was \\nobserved in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback \\nmechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the \\nregulation of HuR during replicative senescence.\", \"HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic \\ndevelopment, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of \\nHuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse \\nmodel (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived \\nmacrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in \\nAU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from \\nElavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs. \\nInterestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is \\nup-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to \\nthe HuR binding sites, suggesting competitive regulation of gene expression. One \\nsuch mRNA encodes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a major regulator \\nof angiogenesis. Immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes and luciferase \\nreporter assays indicate that HuR antagonizes the suppressive activity of \\nmiR-200b, down-regulates miR-200b expression, and promotes VEGF-A expression. \\nIndeed, Vegf-a and other angiogenic regulatory transcripts were down-regulated \\nin Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs. Interestingly, tumor growth, angiogenesis, vascular \\nsprouting, branching, and permeability were significantly attenuated in Elavl1Mø \\nKO mice, suggesting that HuR-regulated myeloid-derived factors modulate tumor \\nangiogenesis in trans.

A common \\nexperimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of \\nmicrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase \\nin combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the \\nresulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and \\nespecially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a \\nconsequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major \\ndeterminant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show \\nthat data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched \\ncontrol experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.', 'A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied \\nfor investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is \\navailable at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have \\ndemonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome \\nformation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional \\nsaturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient \\nnucleosome positioning sites.', 'Nucleosomes form the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, and previous attempts to understand the principles governing their genome-wide distribution have spurred much interest and debate in biology. In particular, the precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been controversial. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of hitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5bp, and poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome landscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to other previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, poly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the experimental method used. We further show that the 10.5bp nucleotide facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying our method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, the regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites can be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone. Finally, in vivo nucleosome occupancy derived from MNase-seq experiments around transcription termination sites can be mostly explained by the genomic sequence. Implications of these results and potential extensions of the proposed computational framework are discussed.']\n",

The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \\nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \\nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \\nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An \\nimplementation of this algorithm is publicly available at \\nftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws.\\nCONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much \\nlarger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful \\nfor applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, \\nthe number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most \\nlinearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow \\nexponentially.

TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted \\nTLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic \\ncells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes \\nsingle-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the \\nproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each \\ncell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage \\nwith XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome \\ninactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been \\nhypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female \\nimmune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. \\nWe review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent \\nevidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, \\nmonocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B \\ncells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven \\nfunctional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the \\nenhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent \\nautoimmune syndromes.', 'Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity, \\nbut TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus \\n(SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also \\nelevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more \\nsupernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement \\ncontributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and \\nwe examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome \\ninactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. \\nSingle-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial \\nfractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells \\nnot only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X \\nchromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 \\ntranscriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher \\nTLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic \\nB cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of \\nCD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold \\nincrease over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class \\nswitch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B \\nlymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation \\nendows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands.

In addition to \\nphosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine \\nacetylation.

A total of 605 women aged 40 to 80 years \\nwho self-reported a most bothersome symptom of dyspareunia and had a diagnosis \\nof vulvar and vaginal atrophy were randomized to take a once-daily dose of \\nospemifene (n = 303) or placebo (n = 302) for 12 weeks.\\nRESULTS: Analysis of the intent-to-treat (n = 605) population found the efficacy \\nof ospemifene to be significantly greater than that of placebo for each of the \\nfollowing coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells, \\nvaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of \\nparabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of \\nsuperficial cells significantly increased; and dyspareunia was significantly \\nreduced versus placebo (all P < 0.0001, except for dyspareunia: P = 0.0001). \\nAmong the randomized women, 186 (61.4%) in the ospemifene group and 154 (51.0%) \\nin the placebo group reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event.

The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference, \\nObesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily \\nemployed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease. \\nThe score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if \\nthey have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher.\\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool \\nfor the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic.\\nMETHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by \\nprimary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had \\nundergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test \\nassigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a \\nbody-mass index of 25kg/m2 to less than 30kg/m2 or 5 points for having a \\nbody-mass index of 30kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being \\nolder than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.\\nRESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck \\ncircumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0% \\nof the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS \\nmodel for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the \\narea under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; \\n0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: \\n(0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability \\nof the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive \\npredictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for \\nmoderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the \\nsame cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe \\nOSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was \\nassociated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA \\nprobability for a score of 17.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with \\nspecificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. \\nFurthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of \\nmoderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this \\nscore can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the \\ndiagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy \\nof this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a \\npredominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease.', 'BACKGROUND: Since the clinical presentation of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome \\n(OSAS) shares common features with major depressive (MDE), the screening of OSAS \\nis challenging in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the \\neffectiveness of the NoSAS score in predicting the presence of OSAS among \\nparticipants with current MDE and to compare it with the performance of existing \\nscreening tools.\\nMETHODS: A random sample of the population-based cohort CoLaus (Lausanne, \\nSwitzerland) underwent a psychiatric evaluation (PsyCoLaus) and a complete \\npolysomnography at home (HypnoLaus). The effectiveness of the NoSAS score in \\ndetecting the risk of significant OSAS among current MDE participants was \\nassessed and compared with STOP-BANG and Berlin scores.\\nRESULTS: Among the 1761 subjects (58,75 ± 11y.o.; 47,8%men) who underwent \\npolysomnography, significant OSAS was present in 24.0% with and 26.1% without \\ncurrent MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in \\nMDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative \\npredictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area \\nunder the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the \\nBerlin score (NS).\\nLIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The \\nstudied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening \\ntools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool \\nfor OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.', 'BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight \\nrecordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low \\navailability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is \\nrecommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of \\nindividuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing.\\nMETHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in \\nLausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at \\nhome, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis \\nand logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant \\nsleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an \\nindependent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing \\nscreening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores).\\nFINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were \\nassessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges \\nfrom 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 \\ncm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2) \\nor 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for \\nsnoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being \\nmale. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified \\nindividuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with \\nan area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even \\nhigher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85). The \\nNoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95% \\nCI 0·65-0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61-0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.\\nINTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement \\nscore enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered \\nbreathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help \\nclinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal \\nrecording.\\nFUNDING: Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne, Lausanne \\nUniversity Hospital, Swiss National Science Foundation, Leenaards Foundation, \\nGlaxoSmithKline, and Vaud Pulmonary League.']), TestResult(name='test_case_7', success=True, metrics_data=[MetricData(name='Faithfulness', threshold=0.5, success=True, score=1.0, reason=None, strict_mode=False, evaluation_model='unsloth/mistral-7b-v0.3-bnb-4bit', error=None, evaluation_cost=None, verbose_logs='Truths (limit=None):\\n[\\n    \"Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria.

HapMap is entirely complimentary to the human genome map \\nand so it is particularly fitting that it should be viewed in a full genomic \\ncontext. However, characterization of high resolution LD across the genome can \\nbe a challenging task, owing in part to the sheer volume of data and the \\ninherent dimensionality that its analysis entails. However, a number of tools \\nare now available to make this task easier for researchers.

The data generated by the HapMap also has other important \\napplications, informing, for example, on the demographic history and evidence of \\nselection in human populations and on previously undetected regulatory \\nrelationships and gene networks.

Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian \\nviruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although \\nonly around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around \\nhalf again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible \\npredictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of \\nphylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new \\nhuman viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for \\nthe foreseeable future.

Initially, Regeneron entered into a \\njoint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment \\nof rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of \\nphase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited \\nbenefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from \\nthe Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two \\ncryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial \\ncold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \\nfor children and adults 12 years and older. CAPS is a group of inherited \\ninflammatory disorders consisting of FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem \\ninflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as chronic infantile neurologic, \\ncutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous \\nmutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or \\ncryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent \\nof IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but \\nwith limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta, \\ninitially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/ \\nAmgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in \\nCAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of \\nthese conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by \\ncytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer \\nhalf-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not \\ntolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The \\ninitial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS \\nsuggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet \\nto be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other \\nchronic inflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever and \\nsystemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.', 'Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a subgroup of the hereditary \\nperiodic fever syndromes, which are rare autoinflammatory and inherited \\ndisorders, characterized by recurrent inflammation and varying degrees of \\nseverity. CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of \\ninterleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of \\nfunction mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is \\nsupported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions. \\nRilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug \\nAdministration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome \\nand Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for \\nlonger-acting IL-1 blockade.

The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept \\nin CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review.

Conventional \\ntherapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit \\ncancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also \\nresponsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint \\ninhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to \\ndeplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as \\nweapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the \\nreprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral \\nmacrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the \\nquantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and \\npulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and \\ntheir receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from \\ncarcinoids of intestinal origin.\\nMETHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) \\nlocalizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and \\nradioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and \\ndetermine BLP levels in these tumors.\\nRESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present \\non pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary \\ncarcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP \\nlevels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor \\nligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from \\nthe carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction \\nmarker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different \\nreceptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

In this report, we \\ndemonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides, \\nneuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung \\ncarcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \\n(RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 \\nof the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in \\nthe majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE \\ngradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions \\nof culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography \\n(HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of \\nseven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were \\nproduced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were \\nproduced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times \\nthat of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were \\nequivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR \\nand NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was \\nadapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed \\nA549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. \\nUsing either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and \\nGRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for \\nBLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and/or receptor \\nsubtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially \\nrecognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in \\nthe BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The \\n2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that \\nshowed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against \\nthe 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), \\ncompared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and \\nNMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and \\nGRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and \\nexpression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and \\nexpression of the GRP receptor.

Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single \\nuniversally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard \\ncytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of \\nselumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients.\\nMETHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 \\nstudy in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA. \\nPatients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater \\nthan 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric \\nlow-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for \\ninclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology, \\ntumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the \\nresults of strata 1 and 3. Stratum 1 comprised patients with WHO grade I \\npilocytic astrocytoma harbouring either one of the two most common BRAF \\naberrations (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAFV600E [Val600Glu] mutation). \\nStratum 3 comprised patients with any neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated \\npaediatric low-grade glioma (WHO grades I and II). Selumetinib was provided as \\ncapsules given orally at the recommended phase 2 dose of 25 mg/m2 twice daily in \\n28-day courses for up to 26 courses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of \\npatients with a stratum-specific objective response (partial response or \\ncomplete response), as assessed by the local site and sustained for at least 8 \\nweeks. All responses were reviewed centrally. All eligible patients who \\ninitiated treatment were evaluable for the activity and toxicity analyses. \\nAlthough the trial is ongoing in other strata, enrolment and planned follow-up \\nis complete for strata 1 and 3. This trial is registered with \\nClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01089101.\\nFINDINGS: Between July 25, 2013, and June 12, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable \\npatients were accrued to stratum 1, and between Aug 28, 2013, and June 25, 2015, \\n25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 3. In stratum 1, nine \\n(36% [95% CI 18-57]) of 25 patients achieved a sustained partial response. The \\nmedian follow-up for the 11 patients who had not had a progression event by Aug \\n9, 2018, was 36·40 months (IQR 21·72-45·59). In stratum 3, ten (40% [21-61]) of \\n25 patients achieved a sustained partial response; median follow-up was 48·60 \\nmonths (IQR 39·14-51·31) for the 17 patients without a progression event by Aug \\n9, 2018. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were elevated \\ncreatine phosphokinase (five [10%]) and maculopapular rash (five [10%]). No \\ntreatment-realted deaths were reported.\\nINTERPRETATION: Selumetinib is active in recurrent, refractory, or progressive \\npilocytic astrocytoma harbouring common BRAF aberrations and NF1-associated \\npaediatric low-grade glioma.

All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian \\nmembrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed \\nup and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant \\nrestoration.\\nRESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate) \\nafter a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis \\nduring the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One \\npatient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was \\ntreated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no \\nassociated implant loss.\\nCONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm \\ntwist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to \\n3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental \\nimplants, one year post-restoration.

J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.', 'BACKGROUND: After tooth loss, the posterior maxilla is usually characterized by \\nlimited bone height secondary to pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and/or \\ncollapse of the alveolar ridge that preclude in many instances the installation \\nof dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several \\ntreatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the \\ninstallation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting \\nmaterials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless, \\nmembrane perforations represent the most common complication among these \\nprocedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the \\nrelevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications.\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed \\nby two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, \\nand Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018 \\nreporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without \\nregenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft \\nmaterial. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant \\nplacement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least \\n6\\u2009months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.\\nRESULTS: Eight studies provided information on the survival rate, with a global \\nsample of 493 implants, being the weighted mean survival rate 95.6% (IC 95%), \\nafter 52.7\\u2009months of follow-up. The level of implant penetration (≤\\u20094\\u2009mm or \\n>\\u20094\\u2009mm) did not report statistically significant differences in survival rate \\n(p\\u2009=\\u20090.403). Seven studies provided information on the rate of clinical \\ncomplications, being the mean complication rate 3.4% (IC 95%). The most frequent \\nclinical complication was epistaxis, without finding significant differences \\naccording to the level of penetration. Five studies provide information on the \\nradiographic complication; the most common complication was thickening of the \\nSchneiderian membrane. The weighted complication rate was 14.8% (IC 95%), and \\npenetration level affects the rate of radiological complications, being these of \\n5.29% in implant penetrating ≤4\\u2009mm and 29.3% in implant penetrating >\\u20094\\u2009mm, \\nwithout reaching statistical significant difference (p\\u2009=\\u20090.301).\\nCONCLUSION: The overall survival rate of the implants into the sinus cavity was \\n95.6%, without statistical differences according to the level of penetration. \\nThe clinical and radiological complications were 3.4% and 14.8% respectively. \\nThe most frequent clinical complication was the epistaxis, and the radiological \\ncomplication was thickening of the Schneiderian membrane, without reaching \\nstatistical significant difference according to the level of implant penetration \\ninside the sinus.', 'PURPOSE: Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA is a virulence factor associated with \\nperiodontal diseases, but its role in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis \\nremains unclear.

Here, we \\npresent LipidMS, an R package aimed to confidently identify lipid species in \\nuntargeted LC-DIA-MS. To this end, LipidMS combines a coelution score, which \\nlinks precursor and fragment ions with fragmentation and intensity rules. \\nDepending on the MS evidence reached by the identification function survey, \\nLipidMS provides three levels of structural annotations: (i) \"subclass level\", \\ne.g., PG(34:1); (ii) \"fatty acyl level\", e.g., PG(16:0_18:1); and (iii) \"fatty \\nacyl position level\", e.g., PG(16:0/18:1).

Our computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to other previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, poly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the experimental method used. We further show that the 10.5bp nucleotide facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying our method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, the regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites can be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone.

It is a minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in y. Minimal \\nabsent words have been computed in genomes of organisms from all domains of \\nlife; their computation also provides a fast alternative for measuring \\napproximation in sequence comparison. There exists an [Formula: see text]-time \\nand [Formula: see text]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words \\non a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata \\n(Crochemore et al., 1998). No implementation of this algorithm is publicly \\navailable. There also exists an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see \\ntext]-space algorithm for the same problem based on the construction of suffix \\narrays (Pinho et al., 2009). An implementation of this algorithm was also \\nprovided by the authors and is currently the fastest available.\\nRESULTS: Our contribution in this article is twofold: first, we bridge this \\nunpleasant gap by presenting an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see \\ntext]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words based on the \\nconstruction of suffix arrays; and second, we provide the respective \\nimplementation of this algorithm. Experimental results, using real and synthetic \\ndata, show that this implementation outperforms the one by Pinho et al. The \\nopen-source code of our implementation is freely available at \\nhttp://github.com/solonas13/maw .\\nCONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being \\nreplaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences \\nin terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent \\nwords. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm \\nfor the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.', 'BACKGROUND: The problem of finding the shortest absent words in DNA data has \\nbeen recently addressed, and algorithms for its solution have been described. It \\nhas been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the \\nexisting algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the \\nshortest ones.\\nRESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the \\ndata, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent \\nwords, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words \\nintroduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \\nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \\nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \\nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An \\nimplementation of this algorithm is publicly available at \\nftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws.\\nCONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much \\nlarger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful \\nfor applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, \\nthe number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most \\nlinearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow \\nexponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed \\nadditional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing \\nstudies on the topic.']), TestResult(name='test_case_82', success=True, metrics_data=[MetricData(name='Faithfulness', threshold=0.5, success=True, score=1.0, reason=None, strict_mode=False, evaluation_model='unsloth/mistral-7b-v0.3-bnb-4bit', error=None, evaluation_cost=None, verbose_logs='Truths (limit=None):\\n[\\n    \"SARTools is an R pipeline for differential analysis of RNA-Seq count data.\"\\n] \\n \\nClaims:\\n[\\n    \"The provided context does not contain information about R packages developed for studying Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which are chromatin structures.\"\\n] \\n \\nVerdicts:\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"verdict\": \"idk\",\\n        \"reason\": null\\n    }\\n]')], conversational=False, multimodal=False, input='Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?', actual_output='The provided context does not contain information about R packages developed for studying Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which are chromatin structures.

To test whether additional polymorphisms \\ncontribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of \\nTLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population.\\nMETHODS: A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the \\nTLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274 \\nhealthy female controls.\\nRESULTS: In addition to rs3853839, two SNPs in intron 2, rs179019 and rs179010, \\nwhich were in moderate linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 = 0.53), \\nshowed an association with SLE (rs179019: P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% \\nconfidence interval (95% CI) 1.15 to 3.54; rs179010: P = 0.018, OR 1.75, 95% CI \\n1.10 to 2.80 (both under the recessive model)).

At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can \\nbe recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. \\nLessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in \\nthe annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be \\nfewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.', \"BACKGROUND: While the C. elegans genome is extensively annotated, relatively \\nlittle information is available for other Caenorhabditis species. The nematode \\ngenome annotation assessment project (nGASP) was launched to objectively assess \\nthe accuracy of protein-coding gene prediction software in C. elegans, and to \\napply this knowledge to the annotation of the genomes of four additional \\nCaenorhabditis species and other nematodes. Seventeen groups worldwide \\nparticipated in nGASP, and submitted 47 prediction sets across 10 Mb of the C. \\nelegans genome. Predictions were compared to reference gene sets consisting of \\nconfirmed or manually curated gene models from WormBase.\\nRESULTS: The most accurate gene-finders were 'combiner' algorithms, which made \\nuse of transcript- and protein-alignments and multi-genome alignments, as well \\nas gene predictions from other gene-finders. Gene-finders that used alignments \\nof ESTs, mRNAs and proteins came in second. There was a tie for third place \\nbetween gene-finders that used multi-genome alignments and ab initio \\ngene-finders. The median gene level sensitivity of combiners was 78% and their \\nspecificity was 42%, which is nearly the same accuracy reported for combiners in \\nthe human genome. C. elegans genes with exons of unusual hexamer content, as \\nwell as those with unusually many exons, short exons, long introns, a weak \\ntranslation start signal, weak splice sites, or poorly conserved orthologs posed \\nthe greatest difficulty for gene-finders.\\nCONCLUSION: This experiment establishes a baseline of gene prediction accuracy \\nin Caenorhabditis genomes, and has guided the choice of gene-finders for the \\nannotation of newly sequenced genomes of Caenorhabditis and other nematode \\nspecies.
